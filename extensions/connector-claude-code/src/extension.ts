 * `claude --model xai/grok-4.6`, which `claude` cannot serve. They did not fail closed - they came
 * up on a Claude model, reported for hours under a grok label, and their operator's written claim
 * of two-vendor corroboration was false in a way nothing observable to them could reveal. The
 * seats were in fact the same family as the agent grading their output.
 *
 * SO THE FAILURE MODE THIS CLOSES IS NOT "wrong model", IT IS "wrong model, silently, with a
 * confident label attached". A launch that refuses costs one spawn. A launch that mislabels costs
 * every conclusion drawn from that seat, retroactively, and there is no artifact in the session to
 * catch it with - the environment variable says grok, and only the process's own argv disagrees.
 *
 * The discriminator is the provider-prefixed `provider/model` form that other runtimes use, since
 * an allow-list of Claude model names would need editing every time one ships and would fail
 * closed on a model that works. `arn:` is exempt: a Bedrock inference-profile ARN legitimately
