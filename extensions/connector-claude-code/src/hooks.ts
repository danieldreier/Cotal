/**
 * The failure a `StopFailure` hook reports, or `undefined` for any other turn end.
 *
 * **THE DECIDING RULE, and it is written down because "which harness signals mean the run failed"
 * is precisely the judgment a connector must make explicitly rather than by accident.** Claude Code
 * chooses between `Stop` and `StopFailure` ITSELF and fires exactly one of them: `Stop` when the
 * model finished responding, `StopFailure` when the turn ended on an error. So EVERY `StopFailure`
 * closes the run with `RUN_ERROR`, and the harness's own `error` value rides along as the code,
 * UNJUDGED. This connector is not claiming to know what a rate limit means; it is relaying a
 * classification the harness already made, on the hook it made it with.
 *
 * The eleven values `error` can take are `authentication_failed`, `oauth_org_not_allowed`,
 * `account_on_hold`, `billing_error`, `rate_limit`, `overloaded`, `invalid_request`,
 * `model_not_found`, `server_error`, `max_output_tokens` and `unknown` (read off the shipped
 * harness's own hook schema, not inferred from a page about it).
 *
 * **TWO OF THEM ARE ARGUABLE AND ARE DECIDED HERE RATHER THAN LEFT IMPLICIT.** `max_output_tokens`
 * is a turn that produced real output and was then cut off, and `rate_limit` is a turn nobody got
 * wrong. Calling either of those "finished" would be this connector overriding the harness on a
 * question the harness had already answered — the exact claim-about-a-harness that kept `RUN_ERROR`
 * unreachable in the first place. Publishing the distinction and letting the reader classify is the
 * cheaper mistake: a consumer holding the code can treat a truncation differently from an auth
 * failure, and a consumer told `RUN_FINISHED` has nothing to treat differently at all.
 *
 * Shape-tolerant on the way in, like every other read of a hook payload here: `error` is required by
 * the harness's schema, and a payload that somehow arrives without one is still a failed turn, just
 * one that cannot name its kind.

 * while the endpoint is mid-reconnect ({@link MeshAgent.setStatus} calls `assertConnected`). They
 * used to sit inside the same try/catch as the delivery work that followed them, so a single failed
 * presence write skipped the injection on `UserPromptSubmit` and — worse — the `Stop` wake flush,
 * leaving held messages with nothing left to deliver them. Presence is observability; the wake path
 * is the product, so presence failures are swallowed here and nothing is sequenced behind them.
 *
 * **Peer messages are surfaced, then committed on handoff.** The injection is built with
 * {@link MeshAgent.peekInbox} and the ids are remembered, not acked. A hook reply still has to reach
 * the runtime through the relay (which abandons the exchange after 2s) and the ids are committed
 * only once {@link ClaudeHooks.onReply} says it did. Acking at format time was silent loss: the
 * message was already in `handledIds`, so its durable redelivery was acked and discarded on arrival
 * and no retry could ever surface it — the peer just never replied.
 *
 * **This is a deliberate choice of at-least-once over at-most-once.** The delivery verdict is not
 * perfectly two-sided, so pick which way it errs:
 *   • reply landed, confirmation lost  ⇒ the batch is surfaced again and the model reads it twice;
 *   • reply lost, treated as delivered ⇒ the message is buried and the peer never answers.
 * The first costs a duplicate injection (labelled — see {@link REPEAT_NOTE}); the second costs the
 * workflow. Do not "fix" the duplicate by committing optimistically: that is the burial this whole
 * file exists to prevent.
 *
 * Deferring the ack to turn completion (the OpenCode connector's `ackSurfaced` on `session.idle`)
 * does NOT substitute for this. `Stop` fires whether or not the reply survived, so it would commit a
 * batch the model never saw — the same loss, later. OpenCode can bind its ack to the turn because
 * `drive()` OWNS delivery; this connector only hands a reply off, so the ack binds to the handoff.
