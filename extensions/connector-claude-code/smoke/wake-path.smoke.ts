/**
 * Claude Code wake-path regression test (no test runner) — spins up its OWN nats-server on an
 * ephemeral port and drives the SHIPPED handler (`createClaudeHandle`) behind the SHIPPED control
 * server, with a real mesh peer sending real DMs. No `claude` binary, no model.
 *
 * It guards the three ways an unattended peer used to go permanently silent — a DM arrives, and
 * nothing ever delivers it, so the peer simply never replies and only a human at the keyboard
 * notices:
 *
 *   1. ACK-BEFORE-DELIVERY. The hook reply travels connector → unix socket → hook relay → stdout →
 *      Claude Code, and the relay abandons it after 2s (`runHookRelay`'s TIMEOUT_MS). The handler
 *      used to `drainInbox()` — which ACKS the JetStream message and marks it handled — while
 *      merely *formatting* that reply. When the reply then failed to land, the message was gone:
 *      `handledIds` turns the durable redelivery into a silent ack, so the DM could never come back.
 *   2. PRESENCE BLOCKING THE WAKE. Every hook branch did `await agent.setStatus(...)` (a broker
 *      round-trip that throws mid-reconnect) inside the same try/catch as the delivery work, so one
 *      failed presence write skipped the `Stop` → `requestWake()` flush of held messages entirely.
 *   3. A DROPPED NUDGE WITH NO RETRY. The `claude/channel` push is an idle session's ONLY wake
 *      source; a rejected notification was logged and forgotten, and no later hook fires to recover.
 *
 * Ack semantics under test: a peer message is COMMITTED only once the reply carrying it is
 * confirmed flushed to the hook client. Anything less must leave it un-acked so JetStream
 * redelivers it.
 *
 * It also pins the same property one layer down, in code this fix depends on and does not own: when
 * the ack itself throws (a JetStream ack publishes, so a closed connection fails), the message must
 * come back. That holds only because `commitPending` acks BEFORE marking handled; reverse those two
 * lines and a failed ack is marked handled without being acked, which is this branch's original bug
 * with a new cause. Nothing else in the repo covers that ordering.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:claude-wake

// human's session. Silent fail open is not, and it was what shipped. A material file that is
// missing, permissive, malformed or contradicted by a direct carrier produced a hook that did
// nothing and said nothing, so the seat ran with dead presence and no injected messages and there
// was no line anywhere to read. The same defect, in Python, is what smoke:hermes-hooks-control
// exists for; this is the TypeScript half of it.
//
// R3 is the discrimination and is the reason this is three legs rather than one. Warning whenever
// there is no control endpoint would fire on every hook of a legitimate hand-driven session, which
// is how a warning channel gets trained into background noise.
