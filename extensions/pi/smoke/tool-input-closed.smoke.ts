/**
 * PI IS THE HOST THAT ALREADY ENFORCED, AND THE CODE USED TO OPT OUT OF IT.
 *
 * pi validates a tool call strictly against the JSON Schema it was registered with, so it is the one
 * adapter whose host would refuse an unmodelled key without being asked. The converter here used to
 * suppress exactly that: it wrapped the shared raw shape in a plain `z.object` and converted under
 * `io:"input"` specifically because the default io emits `additionalProperties: false` — chosen, in
 * its own words, so pi would match the Claude Code / OpenCode STRIP behaviour. It matched the wrong
 * thing. Those hosts now refuse too, and a rationale for opting out of a refusal must not outlive
 * the behaviour it was matching.
 *
 * A closed object emits `additionalProperties: false` under EVERY io mode, so closing pi cost the
 * io choice nothing: `io:"input"` remains because this schema describes what a caller may SEND, and
 * it no longer decides closure.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, against the parameters handed to the real `pi.registerTool`:
 *   1. tools with arguments are actually registered   <- the control
 *   2. every one of them carries `additionalProperties: false`
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER: the refusal itself. pi's validator is pi's, not ours, and it is not in
 * this process — this grades what we hand it, which is the half we own. The refusal is graded at the
 * hosts we can drive end to end (the MCP renderer) and at the dispatches we own (OpenCode, Hermes).
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:pi-tool-closed
