/**
 * The AG-UI event VOCABULARY and the Cotal frame envelope.
 *
 * This is the file that makes the change an abolition rather than a rename. Renaming `tr-<name>` to
 * `events.<name>` while the connectors went on publishing `condense()` output would have moved
 * glyph-prefixed text to a new channel and changed nothing a consumer can do with it — the channel
 * name was never the complaint. The mirror is now gone from the tree rather than renamed, and this
 * vocabulary is what replaced it.
 *
 * **The vocabulary is adopted; the SDK is not.** `@ag-ui/core` is a `devDependency`,
 * pinned EXACT at `0.0.57`, and this file imports from it with `import type` ONLY. The reason is
 * measured rather than stylistic: `0.0.57` declares `dependencies: { zod: "^3.22.4" }` (verified
 * against the registry, not remembered), and `connector-core` is esbuild-bundled into every seeded
 * connector — so a runtime dependency would ship a second zod major to every customer in order to
 * validate events we construct ourselves. The conformance smoke imports the real schemas and
 * validates against them; production code carries types and string literals and no zod.
 *
 * **Promotion trigger, conditional and NOT scheduled:** if a 0.1.x ships stable with zod moved to
 * `peerDependencies`, promote to a runtime dependency and use the schemas directly. As of this
 * writing `latest` is `0.0.57`, the active `canary` still carries the zod-3 runtime dep, and the
 * release that moves zod to a peer sits on no dist-tag at all.
 *
 * ## What is here, and what is deliberately NOT
 *
 * Here: the event constructors, the frame envelope, the routing/validity split
 * ({@link isAguiFramePart} / {@link parseAguiFrame}), the {@link AguiBrackets} stream machine, and
 * the `cotal.*` `CUSTOM` table, which is empty in v1.
 *
 * Not here, and NAMED rather than stubbed, because a stub is a claim that the shape is known: the
 * channel derivation, the `max_payload` split, and the emitter that publishes. Each of those talks
 * to something outside this module, and each lands with the surface that calls it.
 *
 * **Nothing constructs a frame outside a smoke.** No connector emits, and this module publishes
 * nothing: every export below is a pure function of its arguments. That is a statement about the
 * tree, not a disclaimer — a reader deciding whether a change here can reach a customer needs it to
 * be accurate, so it is maintained rather than left to rot.

 * consumer detect a gap rather than merely fail to notice one.
 *
 * **A frame carries no text part, by design.** That is why the renderers are a binding precondition
 * on the cutover rather than a follow-up.
 *
 * **RE-DERIVED, because core changed underneath this sentence.** It used to end "a viewer that does
 * not understand this part shows nothing, and an empty pane is indistinguishable from a
 * correctly-empty one." That is now true of some surfaces and false of others, and the split is
 * exactly which ones adopted core's shared `partsToText`:
 *
 *   - **3 ADOPTED IT** — `connector-core/src/agent.ts`, `cli/src/commands/join.ts`,
 *     `cli/src/view/mesh-view.ts`. These now render a marker naming the kind.
 *   - **4 DID NOT** — `implementations/web/src/web/app.js`, `.../graph.js`,
 *     `examples/02-self-improving-console/harness/observer.ts`,
 *     `examples/04-frontier-faces/tools/studio.mjs`. The two stringify-form copies still leave a

 * well-formed sentence with a silent hole in it, so it prompts no question at all.**
 *
 * **THE PRECONDITION IS UNCHANGED AND THE MARKER IS NOT A LOOPHOLE IN IT.** A named marker proves a

 * as **a function a consumer executes**, not as a shape a consumer is trusted to have read.
 *
 * **THE TWO ANSWERS ARE DIFFERENT AND MUST NOT BE FUSED.** "This part is not mine" is a routing
 * decision a consumer makes constantly and quietly — every non-frame part on a channel it also
 * reads. "This part claims to be mine and is malformed" is a defect that must be LOUD. One function
 * returning `null` for both would make a version skew look exactly like someone else's message, and
 * a renderer would show an empty pane for a stream it is actively failing to parse. So:

// adds `id`, `ts`, `space`, `from` and `channel` AFTER the publish call, and the JetStream client
// adds `Nats-Msg-Id` and `Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence`, all of which the broker charges
// against `max_payload`. A splitter that sized the frame from here would be measuring the FRAME
// while the broker measures the MESSAGE — and it would be wrong in the dangerous direction, because
// the part it produced would be REJECTED, and a rejected truncation makes the loss silent again,
// which is the exact failure splitting exists to prevent. Measured against a 4096-byte broker, a
// 3994-byte payload was refused while naive arithmetic said it fit by a hundred bytes.
//
// So `measure` is injected. In production it is `CotalEndpoint.encodedSize` bound to the real
// channel and expectation; in a cell it is any function, which is what makes the algorithm testable
// without a broker. Two places that both compute size WILL drift, and the drift is invisible until
// a frame near the ceiling meets a real broker — the one case no unit test builds.

 * Split `events` into as many frames as the wire requires, truncating only what physically cannot

 *
 * **THIS IS THE PREVIEW PLANE'S SPLITTER, AND IT HAS NO DURABLE-PLANE CALLER BY DESIGN.**
 * Read that as a boundary, not as an oversight: the durable emitter packs with {@link packUnits} at
 * SOURCE-RECORD boundaries and refuses an oversized unit, because one durable emit unit must be one
 * frame carrying a cursor that resumes after it, and a frame ending mid-record has no cursor it can
 * honestly store. This event-boundary split and its labelled truncation were specified before the
 * durable plane had a cursor contract; where the two disagree, the durable plane's rule wins. The
 * PREVIEW plane has no resume obligation at all, which is exactly where truncate-and-label is the
 * right answer and why this machinery is worth keeping.
 *
 * **Calling this from the durable emitter would be a silent-loss bug**, not a performance choice —
 * so if you are here looking for the packer, you want `packUnits`. And it is marked rather than
 * deleted for the reason one module over already demonstrated: `assertExpectationSemantics()` sat
 * with zero production callers looking exactly like live code, and unreachable code that looks live
 * is a hazard whichever direction the next reader resolves it in.
 *
 * **Say the uncomfortable thing:** this is a content truncation, which is one of the
 * sins `tr-` is being abolished for. The difference is not that we are gentler about it. `tr-` cut
 * *every* result at 700 characters, silently and unconditionally, as a design choice; this cuts only
 * what cannot physically be sent, three orders of magnitude higher, and records what it cut and how
 * big it was. If routine results start tripping the ceiling the honest response is a
 * content-addressed side channel, not a quieter limit.
 *
 * **Splitting happens on EVENT boundaries**, each part carrying its own `seq`, so a run may legally
 * open in one frame and close in the next. That is why {@link AguiBrackets} checks the writer's
 * stream and not the frame — a per-frame balance check would forbid the split this function
 * performs.
 *
 * **`seq` is measured, not assumed.** Each candidate is measured at the `seq` it will actually carry,
 * because `seq` is a header-adjacent value in the encoded body: sizing at 9 and publishing at 10 is
 * one byte, and a frame one byte over the ceiling is refused. The same reason `encodedSize` takes
 * `expectedLastSubjectSeq` as a parameter rather than sizing at zero.
 *
 * @param measure the EXACT encoded size of a candidate, headers included — `CotalEndpoint.encodedSize`
 *   in production. Never re-implement it here.
 * @param limit the broker's `max_payload`.
 * @throws {AguiVocabularyError} if a single event cannot be made to fit even fully truncated, or
 *   carries no truncatable field. Failing loud is required: the alternative is looping forever or
 *   dropping the event, and a dropped event on this plane is the silent loss the plane exists to

 * on its own, but a frame that ends mid-record has no cursor it can honestly store: the only value
 * available says the whole record was consumed, and folding that after a crash skips the rest of the
 * record's events with no `seq` gap for a consumer to notice.
 *
 * **So the event-boundary split and the one-unit-one-frame rule are in tension, and this resolves it
 * in the direction the durable plane requires: a single unit that does not fit FAILS LOUD rather
 * than being truncated at a frame boundary.** That leaves `splitFrames`'s truncation path with no
 * caller on the durable plane, which is reported as a design conflict rather than decided here.

   * starts, so a finished agent renders as still running, and the last run of a session never closes
   * at all, because there is no later record to close it on. This is that vehicle.

   * It is a FRAME LIKE ANY OTHER: same epoch, same `seq` line, same write-ahead discipline, same
   * halt rules. The single thing that differs is the cursor, which is republished UNCHANGED, because

   * consumed that were never mapped.
   *

   * remember; with one method and one branch it is a property of the shape: exactly one terminal is
   * built, and the bracket machine has closed the run by the time anything could ask for another, so
   * a following close answers `null` like any other close on a settled stream. Which harness signals
   * mean a turn FAILED is a connector's decision and is stated at each connector's own mapping site;
   * this file only carries the answer to the wire.
   *
   * **AN OVERSIZED `error.message` IS BOUNDED HERE, ONCE, FOR EVERY CONNECTOR.** The message is
   * upstream free text. If it cannot fit in the one closing frame, the close rebuilds the event so
   * it does, keeps the `code`, and the emitted message says the original detail was omitted or
   * shortened because of the bound. A short message is unchanged. The alternative is `packUnits`
   * refusing before `beginSend`, which leaves the run with no terminal and kills the holder.

   * - `duplicate` → HALT. On a first attempt it means a body WE DID NOT WRITE holds our id, and

   *   never published. On a retry it cannot happen on a single-replica stream at all, because such a
   *   stream evaluates the expectation before the dedup cache, so observing it proves the stream is
   *   not single-replica. Both are
   *   fail-loud, and neither is a case where guessing is better than stopping.
   * - CAS loss → HALT. Someone else moved the tip on a subject only this principal may write, or
   *   the subject was purged. Uncertainty plus a moved tip is exactly what must not be guessed at.
   *
   * A NETWORK error is deliberately none of these: it leaves `pending` as `sent_unacked`, which is
   * the state that means "we do not know", and the next boot retries the same frozen frame.
