 * The `cotal_orientation` card — a structured, versioned self/context snapshot an agent reads to

 *
 * Built from the SAME {@link AgentConfig} (+ the gated tool list the connector exposes) that gates the
 * tools, so it can never drift from what's actually enforced. Connector-local introspection — an agent
 * reading its own minted grants — NOT a wire/SPEC capability handshake.
 *
 * The typed {@link Orientation} object is the source of truth; {@link renderOrientation} is one view of
 * it (the text the model reads). A future MCP resource can JSON-stringify the object directly.
