 * The spawned-agent env (P3) - the single chokepoint for what a child process sees.
 *
 * Connectors build the child's env as `{ ...launchEnv(...), <COTAL_* identity>, <connector vars> }`
 * and runtimes pass only that env. The default is a fixed OS allow-list, the machine-wide
 * {@link OPERATOR_ENV_KEEP} knobs, connector-declared provider keys, and `mcpKeys` — never the
 * manager's ambient environment. This is both a capability and a session-identity boundary:
 * sockets, temporary credentials, and host markers such as `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` must not
 * become properties of every seat merely because an ancestor ran `cotal up` inside a host.
 * An operator deliberately expands the boundary only through `spawn.env`.
 *
 * Scope this is HONEST about (P6). This does not close filesystem secret access: HOME / XDG /
 * platform config dirs are forwarded, so a child with a shell reads ~/.aws, ~/.ssh, ~/.config and
 * ~/.cotal straight off disk. An allow-list stops env-ONLY secrets - an `aws-vault exec` or
 * `op run` shell, CI-injected values - and nothing that has a file behind it. Nor does it close
 * model-key exfil: a key-based agent holds its provider key in its own process in order to do
 * inference. Cotal's own connection material is not in the environment at all: {@link materialEnv}
 * moved the credential, the broker address and the control token behind a 0600 file.

 * **AMBIGUITY IS REFUSED, NOT RESOLVED, AND IT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE FUNCTION.** Display names

 * reinstate the exact defect the re-key removed — two distinct principals fused onto one answer —

 * determined from either is reported as such rather than skipped, because silently skipping the one
 * row that mattered turns a wrong answer into a confident wrong answer.
