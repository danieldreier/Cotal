  // schemaless, and every adapter's schemaless path accepts whatever it is handed. `cotal_roster`
  // with `{owner, actor}` therefore succeeded on all five hosts while this factory advertised that
  // it had closed the seam. A no-argument tool gets a closed EMPTY object, so the refusal is the
  // same refusal everywhere and "takes nothing" never degrades into "takes anything".
