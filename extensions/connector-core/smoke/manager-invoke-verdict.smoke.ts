/**
 * WHAT A PEER-SIDE MANAGER CALL TELLS AN AGENT WHEN IT FAILS.
 *
 * `MeshAgent.managerInvoke` renders every manager-endpoint failure into the one line the `cotal_*`
 * tools hand back to an agent. It used to decide "nobody answered" from the CATALOG CODE — anything
 * `deadline-exceeded` got *"no responder answered - a manager may be down, or this credential holds
 * no <cmd> capability and the broker denied the request"*, and everything else got its bare code.
 * The code is not evidence of silence, and keying on it was wrong in BOTH directions:
 *
 *   - The broker's no-responders 503 is raised as `unavailable`, WITH the marker (endpoint-verbs
 *     `epCall`). That is the case where the capability-denial explanation is most certain, and the
 *     code-keyed branch was the one case that withheld it.
 *   - An answered `ok:false` describe is ALSO `unavailable`, WITHOUT the marker, and deliberately so.
 *     A manager answered. Telling an agent nobody did invites the retry that duplicates a spawn.
 *
 * THE AMBIGUOUS CELL, AND ITS TWIN. `unavailable` is correct under both conditions above, so no
 * single cell here pins anything. Cells 1 and 3 are the same code with the marker present and
 * absent, and they must render OPPOSITELY; either alone would stay green under a renderer that
 * ignored the marker entirely.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE. The errors below are CONSTRUCTED, so this grades the rendering
 * and nothing about the wire. That core attaches the marker exactly where it observed silence and
 * withholds it where a responder answered is gated separately and live, in `smoke:ep-invoke`
 * (`endpoint-invoke.smoke.ts:127` the deadline IS marked, `:139` an answered ok:false is NOT — "the
 * code alone is not evidence of silence"). Neither suite is sufficient alone.
 *
 * No broker: the MeshAgent constructor builds an endpoint but never connects, so `ep` is swapped for
 * one that throws. Run: pnpm smoke:manager-invoke-verdict
