/**
 * A DESTRUCTIVE READ MAY ONLY CLEAR WHAT IT ACTUALLY HANDED OVER (Cotal #603).
 *
 * The defect is a COMPOSITION, and no one of its three parts is wrong on its own:
 *
 *   1. `cotal_inbox` clears what it returns, which is fine in steady state;
 *   2. recovery is when the payload is LARGEST, because reconnecting brings a channel-history
 *      replay with it;
 *   3. a payload can exceed what the caller can receive, because the host caps a tool result.
 *
 * Composed, the recovery read consumes a real direct message inside a response the caller never
 * gets. Measured on this box before the fix, with the occupant below: one call returned 463,788
 * chars, marked all 200 messages read, and left the inbox at 0, including a live DM whose sender
 * had to resend it first-party.
 *
 * THE OCCUPANT IS THE MEASURED ONE, not a convenient one: 199 replayed channel messages at ~2.3 KB
 * each (451 KB / 200, the real reconnect's shape) with one live DM among them.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS THE WRONG EXPERIMENT, stated so a later reader can check it rather than
 * trust it:
 *
 *   • If the cells asserted only "the response is small", a fix that TRUNCATED the text would pass
 *     while still acking the messages it cut off. So every size cell is paired with a possession
 *     cell: what is not in the response is still in the buffer, by id.
 *   • If the cells only ever put ONE DM in the window, "mail before replay" would be indistinguish-
 *     able from luck. Cell 3 therefore overflows the window with DMs alone and walks the buffer to
 *     empty, asserting each DM is delivered exactly once and none is dropped.
 *   • If no cell exercised a small inbox, a fix that held mail back forever would also pass. Cell 4
 *     is that inverse control: below the window, one call still returns everything and clears it.
 *   • These cells drive the tool spec's own `run` against a real MeshAgent, not a copy of the
 *     selection logic. A suite that re-implemented `windowInbox` would grade its own arithmetic.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:inbox-window   (pure in-process, no nats-server needed)
