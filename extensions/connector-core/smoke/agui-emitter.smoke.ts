/**
 * The event emitter: the replica preflight's production call site, the one-unit-one-frame packing
 * rule, and the halts that are supposed to be halts.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL HERE AND WHAT IS NOT, stated up front because it decides what these cells prove.
 * The `EventWal` is real and on a real filesystem. The `JsonlFileSource` is real and reads real
 * appended bytes. ONLY the broker is substituted, and it is substituted by an instrument that
 * RECORDS every call rather than one that pretends to succeed — because most of what this suite
 * asserts is about calls that must NOT happen, and a mock that only knows how to return a value
 * cannot testify to an absence.
 *
 * THE ORDERING CELLS ARE THE POINT OF THE FILE. `assertExpectationSemantics()` shipped with ZERO
 * production callers: a check that existed, had its own suite, and never ran anywhere real. Moving
 * it into `AguiEmitter.start()` is only worth something if it runs BEFORE anything can publish, and
 * the publish that matters most is the one recovery makes — a `sent_unacked` frame re-published with
 * a frozen id. A preflight placed after recovery would leave exactly that publish outside the guard
 * while looking, in a diff, identical.
 *
 * THE HALT CELLS RE-READ THE WAL FROM DISK. Asserting on the in-memory frontier of the object that
 * just halted proves the object did not mutate a field; the claim is that NOTHING WAS PERSISTED, and
 * only a fresh `EventWal.open()` of the same path can say that.
 *
 * KILL SET, predicted as NAMES before the run:
 *   E1  run the preflight AFTER recovery instead of before
 *       -> `preflight:runs-before-RECOVERY-republishes-a-frozen-frame` ONLY. Every other cell stays
 *          green, including the ordinary preflight cell, because on a WAL with no pending frame the
 *          two orderings are indistinguishable. That is the whole danger.
 *   E2  treat a duplicate ack as success (fold it) instead of halting
 *       -> `halt:duplicate-on-a-FIRST-attempt-does-not-move-the-frontier-ON-DISK`
 *   E3  publish frames splitting at EVENT boundaries, so an oversized unit is truncated rather than
 *       refused -> `pack:one-observation-one-frame-a-single-oversized-unit-FAILS-LOUD`
 *   E4  let one frame carry two runs -> `pack:a-run-change-flushes-even-when-the-frame-has-room`
 *   E5  drop the cursor-only advance on an empty map -> `cursor-only:an-adopt-persists-its-cursor`
 *   E6  size with a SHORT id instead of the longest admissible one
 *       -> `sizing:the-UPPER-BOUND-keeps-a-packed-frame-under-the-REAL-ceiling`. Added because the
 *          two earlier sizing cells assert a property of `encodedSize` and NOT of the emitter, so
 *          they would have stayed green with `SIZING_ID` set to anything at all.
 *
 * ALL SIX KILLED, each on the cell it was predicted against, with the run's outcome recorded rather
 * than the prediction restated. E5 first came back KILLED-but-with-ZERO-MARKS — the right verdict
 * from a suite that had died rather than failed, which is the worse version of that defect because
 * a correct verdict invites no second look. Fixed by running each fixture block inside a guard.
 *
 * SECOND KILL SET (the [D1] interim: a bracket refusal must say WHOSE fault it is), predicted as
 * NAMES before its run. The two conditions are tested by their INVERSES, because each one alone
 * produces a CONFIDENT WRONG diagnosis — worse than the anonymous error it replaced, since a named
 * cause stops the search:
 *   B1  drop the "this process has fed nothing yet" condition
 *       -> `bracket:CONTROL-a-violation-after-this-process-FED-but-never-FOLDED-is-NOT-blamed-on-lost-state`
 *   B2  drop the "the frontier is non-virgin" condition
 *       -> `bracket:CONTROL-a-violation-on-a-MIGRATED-VIRGIN-frontier-is-NOT-blamed-on-lost-state`
 *   B3  never diagnose; surface the raw refusal
 *       -> `bracket:a-mid-run-restart-names-ITSELF-not-the-writer`
 *   B4  drop the "the WAL cannot say what was open" condition (added with WAL v2)
 *       -> `bracket:CONTROL-a-violation-after-a-RESTORED-restart-is-NOT-blamed-on-lost-state`
 *   V1  migrate a v1 document to an EMPTY bracket state instead of UNKNOWN
 *       -> `bracket:a-mid-run-restart-names-ITSELF-not-the-writer`
 *   V2  do not restore the persisted machine at startup
 *       -> `bracket:a-mid-run-restart-CONTINUES-because-the-state-was-persisted`
 *   V3  fold does not promote the frame's frozen bracket state
 *       -> `bracket:the-open-run-is-PERSISTED-in-the-WAL`
 * B1 and B2 are the pair worth reading together: each one leaves the headline cell GREEN and kills
 * only its own control, which is what a confident wrong diagnosis looks like from the inside.
 *
 * AND B1/B2 NAME DIFFERENT CELLS ABOVE THAN THEY DID ONE COMMIT AGO, BECAUSE WAL v2 SILENTLY
 * INVALIDATED THEIR OLD ONES. Both were KILLED before v2 and both SURVIVED after it, on an
 * unchanged predicate and unchanged controls. Adding the third condition (`the WAL cannot say what
 * was open`) meant every case those controls exercised was already answered by it — each used a v2
 * WAL, whose bracket state is non-null — so conditions 1 and 2 could be deleted with nothing
 * noticing. That is this fleet's own rule arriving from the other side: DEFENCE IN DEPTH DEFEATS
 * OUTCOME-BASED TESTING, and a control written against a two-term predicate does not survive a
 * third term for free.
 *
 * The diagnosis was NOT "equivalent mutant" and NOT "weak assertion" — those need opposite repairs
 * and the wrong one here would have deleted a live condition. Both conditions are REACHABLE with
 * `brackets === null` held constant, and neither was covered:
 *   - condition 1 is reached when a batch VALIDATES (setting `fedAnyEvent`) and then fails to PACK,
 *     so nothing folds and the WAL still records no bracket state;
 *   - condition 2 is reached by a MIGRATED v1 document that is also VIRGIN — nothing was ever
 *     published, so nothing could have been lost.
 * The two cells below hold `brackets === null` and vary one condition each. The pre-v2 controls are
 * kept: they no longer discriminate, but they still assert real behaviour, and deleting a cell
 * because a mutation stopped reaching it is how coverage is lost quietly.
 *
 * ALL SEVEN KILLED on their named cells, each with 1 mark against a baseline of 1 — so each verdict
 * came from a suite that RAN and failed, not one that died. Instrument: `pnpm mutation-proof
 * --config ../mut-agui-v2.json`, tree clean before and after.
 *
 * ONE THING NO CELL HERE CAN DISCRIMINATE, said plainly rather than left as an unproven constant:
 * `SIZING_EXPECTATION`. Measuring at `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` is a provable upper bound, but the real
 * expectation is a stream sequence, and reaching a 16-digit one takes ~10^15 messages. A mutation
 * lowering it therefore survives on any reachable fixture. It is an equivalent mutant AT THIS SCALE,
 * not a coverage gap, and the distinction matters because the two need opposite repairs.
 *
