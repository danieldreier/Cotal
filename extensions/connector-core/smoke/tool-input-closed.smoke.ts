/**
 * A TOOL'S ARGUMENT OBJECT IS UNTRUSTED INPUT, AND AN OPEN SCHEMA DROPS THE PART THAT MATTERS.
 *
 * Every `cotal_*` tool is defined once, platform-neutrally, in {@link cotalToolSpecs}, and five
 * adapters render from that one source: the shared MCP renderer here (Claude Code), the Codex MCP
 * renderer, OpenCode, pi, and Hermes. The specs are AUTHORED as raw Zod shapes because that reads
 * better inline; `cotalToolSpecs` closes each one exactly once on the way out, so no author can
 * forget and no adapter can be handed an open schema.
 *
 * WHY CLOSURE, AND NOT MERELY VALIDATION. A plain `z.object` does not reject an unmodelled key — it
 * STRIPS it. So a call carrying `owner` or `actor` alongside the real arguments does not fail; it
 * succeeds, having quietly discarded exactly the fields a caller would use to speak for someone
 * else. The tool then does something subtly different from what its caller asked, and the caller is
 * told nothing. A refusal that names the key is strictly better than a success that hides it: the
 * model can read it and repair, which a silent strip gives it no way to do.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS:
 *
 *   1. at least one spec carries a schema                 <- the control (see below)
 *   2. EVERY spec's schema refuses an unmodelled key      <- the closure itself, at the source
 *   3. the shared MCP renderer EMITS `additionalProperties: false` on tools/list
 *   4. an MCP tools/call carrying identity-shaped extras is REFUSED TO THE CALLER
 *   5. ...and the tool's `run` never executes
 *
 * (1) is a control, not decoration: if `cotalToolSpecs` ever returned schemaless specs, every
 * closure assertion below would pass vacuously over an empty set.
 *
 * (3) and (4) are separate claims on purpose. Emitting `additionalProperties: false` only advertises
 * the rule; a host that advertises and does not enforce leaves the strip in place while looking
 * covered. The two adapters whose hosts do NOT enforce — OpenCode and Hermes — therefore close at
 * their own dispatch instead, and assert it in their own suites; nothing above them has touched
 * those args, so that is the real boundary and not a stand-in for one.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, said plainly: it grades the shared renderer, not the four other render
 * sites — those are graded in their own packages, because an assertion made here about a host this
 * package cannot import would be an assertion about a copy of the thing under test.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:tool-input-closed
