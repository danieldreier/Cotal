/**
 * The un-ack reprieve has to end.
 *
 * #793 stopped the overflow valve acking a directed message it evicts, so the broker can redeliver
 * it once there is room instead of destroying it. That turned unrecoverable loss into a delay - but
 * a delay only helps if it terminates. An un-acked id is one JetStream may hand straight back into
 * an inbox that is still full, to be evicted again, forever: throughput spent on a message that
 * never lands, while every seat involved reports healthy (#807).
 *
 * Same defect shape as #790, where `drive()` retries a failed turn with no backoff and no cap. This
 * suite exists because I shipped that shape one layer up after filing it against someone else.
 *
 * The rule: count evictions per id, and after OVERFLOW_REDELIVERY_LIMIT give up and ack, recording
 * the loss loudly. A message lost with a log line beats a mesh that quietly stops moving.
