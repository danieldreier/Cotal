/**
 * A peer flooding a channel must not be able to silence directed mail.
 *
 * The overflow valve sacrifices `pullOnly` entries first, and `pullOnly` is
 * `!mentionsMe && historical`. `mentionsMe` comes from the payload `mentions` field, which the code
 * itself calls forgeable. A hostile peer stamping the victim's name on every flooded message made
 * none of its traffic pull-only, so `findIndex` returned -1 and eviction fell through to index 0 -
 * the OLDEST entry, i.e. the DM that had been waiting longest. It was spliced out and `ack()`ed
 * without being marked handled, so JetStream never redelivered it: silent, unrecoverable loss (#791).
 *
 * Plain ambient channel traffic at volume did the same thing with no forgery at all.
 *
 * This suite crosses the real valve. The suite shipped with #776 buffered 120 items against a
 * MAX_INBOX of 200, so it never reached the overflow path it was meant to cover.
