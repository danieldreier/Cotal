/**
 * OPERATOR_ENV_KEEP completeness, DERIVED FROM THE CONNECTOR SOURCES.
 *
 * WHAT THE DESIGN RESTS ON. `launchEnv` builds the child from a fixed OS allow-list and then copies
 * {@link OPERATOR_ENV_KEEP} by name. There is no inherit mode, so a connector that starts setting a
 * new `COTAL_` name cannot leak it: the name is simply not on the keep list. The keep list is the
 * half that CAN rot, and it rots in exactly one direction - somebody adds a name to it that a
 * connector actually assigns per spawn, and that name silently starts crossing from one agent into
 * the next.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY, STATED AS A TEST RATHER THAN AS A DOC COMMENT. A name qualifies for the keep list
 * if and only if NO connector assigns it per spawn. That is checkable against the sources instead of
 * against a second hand-written list, so it cannot drift the way a snapshot does: this census reads
 * the connectors themselves and intersects what they assign with what the production list keeps.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. It does not prove the keep list is COMPLETE in the other direction (that
 * every safe name is on it); an absent name simply means a child does not get it, which is a
 * usability question and not a containment one. It grades the direction that leaks.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:operator-env-keep

/** A per-spawn assignment, matched BY SHAPE. Four forms, because the connectors use four:
 *  `env.COTAL_X = v`, a `COTAL_X: v` entry, a computed `[IDENT]: v` key, and a bracket-string
 *  `env["COTAL_X"] = v`. Matching the ASSIGNMENT rather than a bare mention is what keeps a doc
 *  comment or an import from registering as a producer.
 *
 *  WHY THE COMPUTED FORM RESOLVES A MAP AND NOT A NAME. This pattern was once literally
 *  `/\[(LAUNCH_MATERIAL_ENV)\]\s*:/`, with the constant baked into the regex. That did not miss a
 *  SHAPE; it matched the right shape and then refused every instance of it except the one the author
 *  had in mind. Two real per-spawn assignments were invisible to it - `[TOKEN_ENV]` in codex's tui.ts
 *  and `[MCP_TOKEN_ENV]` in its host.ts, the latter declared in a different file again - and adding
 *  those two names to a lookup would have rebuilt the same failure one level up, silent again the day
 *  a third constant is declared. So the constants are DERIVED from the tree: any `const IDENT =
 *  "COTAL_..."` anywhere in the walked sources, collected in a first pass, resolved in the second.
 *  A new constant is graded the day it is written, which is what the prefix strip and the by-shape
 *  file walk already rest on.
 *
 *  The declarations are collected from the WHOLE repo while assignments are still only read from
 *  `extensions/`, and the difference is not an oversight. `LAUNCH_MATERIAL_ENV` is declared in
 *  `packages/core`, so a map built from the connectors alone cannot resolve the sharpest name in the
 *  codebase - the first version of this repair narrowed the map to `extensions/` and the
 *  `COTAL_LAUNCH_MATERIAL` witness below went red on exactly that. Collecting declarations wider is
 *  safe because a declaration only ever RESOLVES a name; it never adds an assignment. */

 *  the census can notice when that stops being true: a scan's blind spot and a clean tree produce the

 *
 *  It is not hypothetical that callers live elsewhere. Two example composition roots call
 *  `launchEnv()`, and the first version of this guard - which simply required every caller to sit
 *  under `extensions/` - reddened on them. They are legitimate: an example configures and
 *  orchestrates and adds no env names of its own, which is exactly the property asserted here.
 *  Requiring the PROPERTY rather than the LOCATION is what keeps this from being an allow-list that
 *  rots the same way the keep list would.
