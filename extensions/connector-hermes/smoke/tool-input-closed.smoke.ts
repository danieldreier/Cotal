/**
 * HERMES VALIDATES OUTSIDE OUR PROCESS, SO THE BRIDGE IS WHERE THE CLOSED OBJECT HAS TO BITE.
 *
 * The descriptors go to a Python sidecar, which hands them to the gateway; tool CALLS then come back
 * over the bridge socket as raw JSON. Whatever the gateway does or does not check, the object that
 * arrives at `onTool` is the model's, untouched by anything of ours. So publishing
 * `additionalProperties: false` is only half the guarantee here — advertising a rule across a
 * process boundary is not enforcing it, and a host that advertises without enforcing looks covered
 * while the unmodelled key sails through to the tool.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, against the real descriptors and the real bridge socket:
 *   1. tools with arguments are published                       <- the control
 *   2. every one of them is published `additionalProperties: false`
 *   3. a `tool` frame carrying identity-shaped extras is REFUSED back over the socket
 *   4. the refusal names the rejected keys and the accepted ones
 *   5. ...and the tool's `run` never executes
 *
 * (5) is what separates a refusal from a report: a strip would also produce a plausible-looking
 * result frame, having already done the thing with the wrong arguments.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:hermes-tool-closed
