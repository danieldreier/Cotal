/**
 * Tool-parity test (no test runner) — the Hermes plugin must expose EXACTLY the shared cotal_*
 * surface, never a hand-drifted subset. The connector renders its tool descriptors from
 * {@link cotalToolSpecs} (connector-core); this asserts the rendered list matches that source and
 * that the artifact the plugin actually consumes (a JSON file) is well-formed.
 *   - same tool names, same order, as cotalToolSpecs;
 *   - every descriptor carries a JSON-Schema *object* for its parameters;
 *   - cotal_inbox has no params and pulls only quiet traffic, so it can't race automatic delivery;
 *   - the whole list round-trips through JSON (it's written to COTAL_TOOLS_FILE).
 * Run: pnpm --filter @cotal-ai/connector-hermes test

// variable. In any shell that already exports COTAL_SERVERS — an agent's, an operator's — it
// resolves to that instead, and an archived run gave no way to tell which. It names its target
// now: a suite that names its target cannot silently change it. Measured, and true today: this
// suite opens no TCP connection to the value at all (verified against a listener that counted
// zero accepts), so the line discloses a CONFIG input, not traffic. If that ever stops being
// true, this line is already where a reader would look.
// This file reaches CI by a DIFFERENT ROAD from its six siblings: it is not a `smoke:*` script
// and no root script names it, so an audit that sweeps the `smoke:ci` chain concludes it is
// unreachable. It runs through this package's own `test` script, which `pnpm -r --if-present
// test` picks up — the repo's `test` root, invoked by `check` and by CI's unit job. Gated, just
// not by the chain. Do not delete this pattern here on the grounds that the file looks dead.
