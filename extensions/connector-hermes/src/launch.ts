/**
 * Hermes launcher / supervisor — the `hermes` connector's command (run from source via tsx).
 *
 * Hermes is a long-lived gateway daemon that creates a fresh `AIAgent` per inbound message, so the
 * mesh endpoint must outlive every turn — it can't ride inside a per-turn MCP server the way it
 * does for Claude Code / Codex. This process OWNS the single {@link MeshAgent} (via the shared
 * {@link startSidecar}) and supervises `hermes gateway run` as its child:
 *
 *   - connector-core **control socket** ← Python presence hooks (relay.ts pattern) → presence
 *   - **bridge socket** ⇄ Python gateway adapter + cotal_* tools (inbound wake/drive, outbound)
 *   - **tools file** → the cotal_* descriptors the plugin registers at load
 *   - an isolated **HERMES_HOME** profile so the operator's own ~/.hermes is never touched
 *
 * The manager runs this in a PTY; stdio is inherited so the gateway's output is what you attach to.
