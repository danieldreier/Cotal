/**
 * Codex rollout records to AG-UI events.
 *
 * The durable record is the thread's rollout JSONL, not the app-server notification stream. The
 * stream cannot make brackets legal across a restart, which is the property the emitter exists to
 * provide, so the file is the record of truth and the stream is only how the host learns a thread
 * id.
 *
 * Every rollout record is `{timestamp, type, payload}`. `type` is the envelope kind
 * (`response_item`, `event_msg`, `session_meta`, `turn_context`, `world_state`, `compacted`) and
 * `payload.type` is the inner kind for the first two. This mapper reads BOTH, because the same
 * inner name appears under different envelopes and means different things: `agent_message` is an
 * `event_msg` mirror of an assistant turn AND a `response_item` for inter-agent traffic.
 *
 * Derived against a real app-server thread, not against the operator's own
 * sessions: `originator` is `cotal` there and the primer records ahead of the first turn do not
 * occur in an operator corpus at all.
