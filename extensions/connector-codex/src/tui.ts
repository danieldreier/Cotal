/**
 * The real Codex TUI, attached to the agent's mesh thread.

 * app-server the host is already driving, and REJOINS the running thread rather than starting a
 * private one. That is what makes `cotal spawn --agent codex` land you in Codex proper: the mesh
 * turns the host drives render here as they happen, and anything typed here is a real user turn
 * on the same thread, with the cotal_* tools still routed back to the host's mesh endpoint.
 *
 * The TUI owns the terminal (stdio inherited), so the host must not write to it — see host.ts,
 * which redirects its own logging to a file for exactly this reason.
