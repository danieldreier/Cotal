/**
 * Codex host-mode peer: embeds a Cotal {@link MeshAgent} in the same process as an
 * {@link AppServerDriver}, so a Codex session is a full lateral mesh peer. One process,
 * one endpoint, one thread:
 *
 *  • inbound mesh messages become real Codex turns — a batch wakes an idle thread
 *    (`turn/start`); a DIRECTED message (DM / anycast / @mention) arriving mid-turn is
 *    steered INTO the live turn (`turn/steer`, race-safe via expectedTurnId) — ambient
 *    chatter waits for the turn boundary so it can't derail the work in flight;
 *  • the cotal_* tools are served by THIS process over a loopback MCP endpoint (mcp.ts), so the
 *    model replies itself via cotal_send / cotal_dm — and, because the app-server is the MCP
 *    client, they work on a turn someone typed into the attached TUI just as well as on a
 *    mesh-driven one;
 *  • ack-on-completion with EXACT ids: a turn's surfaced messages are drainInboxDeliveries-acked
 *    ONLY when the turn reaches `completed`. A `failed` turn (transient model/upstream error)
 *    leaves them un-acked and retries with bounded backoff; an `interrupted` turn leaves them
 *    for redelivery — matching the OpenCode connector's semantics — and an app-server CRASH
 *    restarts the child in place (same mesh lifecycle) and re-drives them. Attention modes
 *    hold: ambient drives only in `open`; dnd/focus hold it; a focus @mention wakes a pull
 *    turn (latched until a turn accepts it); quiet stays pull-only.
 *  • presence falls out of the app-server event stream (turn → working, approval → waiting,
 *    item detail → activity), never self-guessed;
 *  • the per-agent CODEX_HOME (under `<workspaceRoot>/.cotal/codex/<name>`) isolates the
 *    child from the operator's config.toml / hooks.json / MCP servers, with the operator's
 *    auth.json symlinked in (re-linked every launch, so a rename-over by a token refresh
 *    can't permanently fork auth state).
 *
 * Identity comes from COTAL_* env (the launcher decides once); a missing identity is a
 * broken launch and fails loud — this binary is never run standalone by an operator.

/**
 * The rollout source, positioned where the BIND was taken rather than where the emitter's own
 * setup finished.
 *
 * A log with no cursor means "start at the current end", and for this connector the current end is
 * the wrong end. The emitter is built lazily inside `adopt`, and between the bind and its first
 * read sit the write-ahead log's directory, the subject frontier, the log itself, a channel
 * resolve and a single-replica preflight: filesystem and broker work, measured at 17ms and 36ms on
 * an idle machine. Every record the session appends while that runs would land behind the later
 * end and be treated as already published, so a turn completing inside the window is dropped,
 * permanently and silently, under a line that has already announced the stream as started.
 *
 * So the boundary is captured at the bind, before the announcement, and substituted HERE, on the
 * one read that would otherwise ask the file where it currently ends.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT WRITTEN INTO THE LOG. The log's cursor stays the emitter's own, and on a
 * log with nothing in it a start writes nothing at all: its recovery has no pending frame to fold,
 * so the position is first written by a PUMP, once one has actually read something. A start that
 * throws therefore leaves nothing behind, and so does a start that succeeded and then died before
 * its first read. Both leave the log virgin and the next bind boundaries at the file as it stands
 * then, which is this same window one level up. A start that throws is the ordinary case here and
 * not an edge: an armed seat whose broker is not up yet loses its emitter at launch and rebinds at
 * a later boundary. A boundary seeded before the start would outlive it, the later bind would read
 * a cursor and treat it as a RESUME, and everything the session wrote while the seat was cut off
 * would be republished onto a channel whose readers are not the input channel's.
 *
 * THE LIMIT, stated once and in one place: this positions the first read of a log that has no
 * cursor. A log that already carries one is a resume and passes through untouched, because a
 * cursor written by a live emitter is the honest one. Each bind builds its own source with its own
 * boundary, so a rebind never reuses an older one.
 *
 * Which makes the bind's own announcement precise for a fresh log and IMPRECISE for a resume, and
 * that is worth saying rather than covering. A bind onto a log that already carries a position
 * CONTINUES that log rather than starting here, and what it delivers is everything the thread
 * appended after that position. That includes what the thread wrote long after the previous
 * emitter was already dead, not merely what that emitter had read and had not sent, which is why
 * the docs state the reach of a recovery rather than describing it as a flush. Nothing is sent
 * twice either way. The line is left as it is because things outside this process parse it, and
 * because the case it is imprecise about is reachable only after an emitter really was publishing
 * this thread.
