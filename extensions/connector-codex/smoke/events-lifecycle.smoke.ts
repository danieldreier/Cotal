/**
 * The event plane's LIFECYCLE, through the real seam: a real broker, the real host process, a real
 * rollout file on disk, and a real subscriber reading the frames off the channel.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS, and it is the campaign's own lesson turned into a file. Every other cell
 * this connector carries proves a COMPONENT: the mapper maps, the resolver resolves, the launch
 * arms. All of them were green while three separate defects sat in the seam BETWEEN them, and all
 * three failed toward silence: the plane stops, one log line lands inside the seat's own process,
 * and a reader sees an empty panel that looks exactly like an agent with nothing to say. A component
 * suite asks "does this work". The question those defects needed was "who else arrives here, and in
 * what state", and only an instrument that enters where the operator does can ask it.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL HERE: the broker (its own `nats-server`), the host (`host-main.ts`, spawned as the
 * manager spawns it), the rollout JSONL (read by a real `JsonlFileSource`), the write-ahead log,
 * and the subscriber (a second endpoint that JOINS the events channel and receives frames).
 *
 * WHAT IS SUBSTITUTED, stated rather than glossed, because a reader deciding how far these cells
 * carry needs it: the agent binary is the same fake the host smoke drives, so the model, the
 * app-server that speaks the protocol, and the writer that appends the rollout are all this
 * fixture rather than upstream codex. What that leaves real is the seam these cells are about, the
 * host process, its bind, the file on disk, the WAL, the channel, and the subscriber. What it does
 * not establish is the record VOCABULARY a real session writes; that is the mapper suite's job,
 * and its own limits are stated there.
 *
 * THE FAKE HAD TO CHANGE, and that change is a finding rather than a convenience. It used to report
 * one constant thread id for every incarnation, so the existing crash cell restarted the app-server
 * onto the SAME thread, a fixture shaped so it could not see the defect. The cold reader on this PR
 * is who noticed. Under `FAKE_CODEX_ROLLOUT` each incarnation now mints its own id, exactly as the
 * real one does, which is what makes case 2 below a test rather than a re-run.
 *
 *   1. first bind: an armed seat publishes its thread's activity, and the frames carry the run.
 *   2. restart: the app-server dies, the host brings up a NEW thread, and the plane KEEPS
 *      PUBLISHING, with every run the dead thread opened closed before the swap.
 *   3. shutdown: a mid-turn exit closes the run the record stream never got to close.
 *   4. late file: a seat whose rollout did not exist when the launch looked still binds later, and
 *      publishes what it had already written.
 *   5. restart INTO a late file: the successor thread's rollout misses the bind budget while a
 *      previous thread is still bound, and the plane must move to the live thread rather than
 *      pumping the dead one forever.
 *   6. broker outage: after honest mesh readiness, a failed initial event-plane start declines
 *      pre-cursor content, while a later outage of an already-running emitter resumes its WAL and
 *      publishes the complete backlog once the broker returns.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:codex-events-lifecycle
