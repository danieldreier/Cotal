/**
 * The Codex mapper, driven against a REAL app-server thread's rollout.
 *
 * The fixture is DERIVED, not authored, and that distinction is the whole argument. It is one real
 * thread produced by this connector's own host: every record, every field name,
 * every ordering and every id is what codex actually wrote. Only free TEXT is replaced, character
 * for character, because the thread ran in the human's workspace and this file is public. An
 * authored fixture would encode the same beliefs the mapper encodes, so it could not catch the
 * mapper being wrong about the record shape, which is exactly what went wrong once already in this
 * lane (the vocabulary was censused on the operator's own sessions, a different population).
 *
 * PROVENANCE IS PRINTED PER CELL, because the ledger is a grading input and a suite that hides it
 * is worse than one that has no cells at all:
 *   `live:`   asserted against the derived real-thread fixture.
 *   `shape:`  asserted against a record built from the MEASURED key-shape census of the 34 394
 *             `response_item` records this mapper reads, message, reasoning, and the two
 *             tool-call families with their outputs, out of 74 031 records across 288 threads
 *             (field names, types and presence counts). The shapes are measured; the
 *             particular record is not real. An exhausted model quota on this account is why, and the
 *             connector live end-to-end proof supersedes every one of these.
 *
 * Never prints record content: cells report counts, type names and ids.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm smoke:agui-codex-map`
