/**
 * THE CODEX CONNECTOR RENDERS THE TOOL SURFACE ITSELF, SO IT CAN DRIFT BY ITSELF.
 *
 * `startCotalMcp` builds its own `McpServer` and registers the shared specs with its own copy of
 * the registration loop — it does not go through connector-core's renderer. That is a deliberate
 * split (Codex needs a bearer-guarded HTTP endpoint and its own `cotal_inbox` override), and it is
 * exactly why the closure has to be graded here too: a suite that proved the shared renderer closes
 * would say nothing about this one, while reading as if the surface were covered.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, against the real endpoint over real HTTP with the real bearer token:
 *   1. tools with arguments are served                            <- the control
 *   2. every one of them advertises `additionalProperties: false`
 *   3. a call carrying identity-shaped extras is REFUSED TO THE CALLER, naming the keys
 *   4. ...and the tool's `run` never executes
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:codex-tool-closed
