/**
 * Codex host turn-loop smoke (no test runner, no model, no real `codex`) — spins up its OWN
 * nats-server and drives the REAL host process (host-main.ts + MeshAgent + AppServerDriver)
 * against a scripted fake `codex app-server` (fake-codex.mjs, via COTAL_CODEX_BIN). Guards the
 * delivery-loop invariants the connector promises:
 *
 *   1. launch surface: argv carries the operator's -c overrides + the autonomy defaults only
 *      where unset; the cotal_* tools are wired as a bearer-authenticated MCP server and
 *      thread/start carries the persona/mesh developerInstructions;
 *   2. wake: a DM drives a real turn carrying the rendered batch;
 *   3. ack-on-completion: a completed turn's batch never redelivers;
 *   4. steer: a directed message arriving mid-turn is steered INTO the live turn;
 *   5. interrupt: an interrupted turn's batch is NOT acked and redelivers immediately;
 *   6. failed: a failed turn's batch is NOT acked — it retries with backoff, and the loop
 *      is released afterwards;
 *   7. tools: a model-initiated MCP tools/call round-trips into the shared cotal_* surface,
 *      and the same call without the bearer token is refused;
 *   8. crash: an unexpected app-server death kills the host nonzero (no wedged endpoint);
 *   9. races: a transiently rejected turn/start retries; a steer whose accept collides with
 *      the turn's completion in ONE chunk never loses the message (it redelivers).
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:codex-host
