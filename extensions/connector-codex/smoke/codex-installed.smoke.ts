/**
 * SHIPPED-PATH smoke — `cotal spawn --agent codex` end to end through the pieces a customer
 * actually runs, none of which any other codex smoke touches:
 *
 *   the built binary (`bin/dist/cotal.js`)
 *     → first-run auto-seed into an empty `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
 *       → the connector resolved from `<config>/cotal/extensions`, NOT this worktree's `src/`
 *         → its registered `codex` Connector building a launch
 *           → the shipped `dist/host.js` under plain node
 *             → a `codex` found on PATH
 *               → a real mesh join, a real turn, a real ack.
 *
 * Every other codex smoke imports `src/` (or runs `dist/host.js` directly), so all of them pass
 * while the shipped path is broken. That gap is not hypothetical: the connector was seeded but
 * unreachable through `--agent codex` until the seed reconciler was fixed, and a stale INSTALLED
 * copy shadowing current source is the single most repeated way a working change looks broken.
 * The env allow-list makes this the only place the PATH lookup is exercised for real, too:
 * `COTAL_CODEX_BIN` is not forwarded to the child, so the fake has to be a `codex` on PATH.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `:live`-gated despite spinning a broker — the delivery path a customer hits is
 * gate-worthy. Kills only the PIDs it starts (never pkill), and sandboxes HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME,
 * and COTAL_HOME so the operator's real codex auth and mesh registry are untouched.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:codex-installed
