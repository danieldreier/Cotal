/**
 * OPENCODE ADVERTISES OPEN AND ENFORCES CLOSED, AND BOTH HALVES OF THAT ARE MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN.
 *
 * The shared specs carry a CLOSED input object so an unmodelled key — `owner`, `actor` — is refused
 * by name instead of silently stripped. On the MCP hosts and pi the host itself refuses one and the
 * tool is never reached. OpenCode is neither of those things, in two ways that pull in opposite
 * directions:
 *
 *   ADVERTISE. Its `args` is a raw SHAPE at runtime, not a schema. Handed the closed object it
 *   walks that OBJECT's own properties as if they were the field map, and the whole `tool.list`
 *   response then fails to serialize — every cotal_* tool disappears from the session, not just the
 *   one. So the adapter renders `spec.schema.shape`, and what OpenCode publishes stays open.
 *
 *   ENFORCE. It does NOT validate before calling us. Its plugin type says `execute(args:
 *   z.infer<z.ZodObject<Args>>)`, but a real call through a real OpenCode session delivered
 *   `{text, owner, actor}` to `execute` intact. Nothing above the adapter has touched those args,
 *   so the adapter's own dispatch is the boundary — closing there is the genuine enforcement point,
 *   not a stand-in for one.
 *
 * The asymmetry is the cost of the host and is worth stating: the model is not told up front that
 * the key is disallowed, it learns from the refusal at call time. That makes the refusal the whole
 * interface, so it names the rejected keys AND lists what the tool does accept — enough for the
 * next attempt to be right without a second guess.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS:
 *   1. the rendered `args` is a raw shape, NOT the closed object   <- or the tool list 400s
 *   2. a call carrying identity-shaped extras is REFUSED
 *   3. the refusal names the rejected keys and the accepted ones
 *   4. ...and the tool's `run` never executes
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER: that OpenCode still passes args through unvalidated. That is the host's
 * behaviour, not ours, and if a future OpenCode starts stripping, (2)-(4) keep passing while the
 * key is dropped upstream — the assertions here would then be measuring our parse against args the
 * host already cleaned. Re-measure through a live session before relying on this as host coverage.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:opencode-tool-closed
