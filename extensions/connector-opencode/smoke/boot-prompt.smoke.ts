/**
 * OpenCode boot-prompt regression test (no test runner) — the two halves of `cotal spawn --prompt`
 * on the OpenCode connector, measured at the seam each one owns.
 *
 * The defect: the connector built its launch spec from `opts` and never read `opts.prompt`, and the
 * plugin only ever drove a turn off the inbox — so a seat spawned with `--prompt` joined the roster,
 * loaded its persona, and then sat at zero messages until something else woke it. The text was
 * accepted at the CLI, documented as auto-submitted, and dropped in silence.
 *
 *   1. LAUNCH SPEC (no broker, no opencode): the spec carries the prompt on the env carrier the
 *      plugin reads, no prompt means no carrier at all, and a prompt with no text in it is refused
 *      at launch rather than started as a seat that ignores it.
 *   2. PLUGIN (a real mesh + a fake OpenCode HTTP server, no model and no `opencode` binary): a boot
 *      with a prompt issues EXACTLY ONE `prompt_async` carrying that text, and later readiness
 *      events (a turn end, a `/new` top-level session) do not issue a second one; a boot without a
 *      prompt issues none at all.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:opencode-boot-prompt
