/**
 * The Cotal OpenCode plugin — loaded in-process by `opencode serve` (via the inline config the
 * connector sets). The serve shim attaches a foreground `opencode` TUI to the session this plugin
 * owns, so the human watches (and can type into) the exact session the agent drives. It turns the
 * session into a first-class mesh peer, at parity with the Claude Code connector:
 *
 *  • holds the {@link MeshAgent} (NATS endpoint, inbox, presence) for the server's lifetime;
 *  • registers the cotal_* tools natively, rendered from the SHARED {@link cotalToolSpecs}
 *    (`./tools.ts`) — same surface as Claude Code, incl. channels / join / leave / channel_info;
 *  • maps OpenCode bus events to presence (idle | working | waiting | offline);
 *  • owns ONE session (created at boot) and drives it: it injects each inbox batch as a turn through
 *    the authenticated OpenCode server HTTP API (the same server the TUI is attached to), acking ON
 *    TURN COMPLETION (so a crash/error redelivers). Automatic pending messages are also injected
 *    into the next native prompt creation when a human/API prompt starts in the attached session;
 *    quiet ambient remains pull-only.
 *    Delivery is **attention-aware** (open/dnd/focus) and never interrupts a running turn.
 *
 * Identity comes from COTAL_* env (the plugin runs in the opencode process and inherits it).
 * No identity → inert, so an operator's own `opencode` never joins as a stray peer.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CONNECTOR GATES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Every guard below sits on the connector's own
 * submission path: `drive` is where this connector starts a turn, and `swapping`, `stopping`,
 * `busy` and `bootPrompt` decide whether IT submits one. The host's own prompt path is a different
 * road. A human typing in the attached TUI, or an API caller hitting the server directly, reaches
 * `chat.message` as a notification the connector cannot refuse: its hooks return `Promise<void>`
 * and influence the host by MUTATING the output object it is handed, and `chat.message`'s output
 * names no cancel and no skip. So a natively submitted prompt REACHES THE HOST whether or not this
 * connector is stopping, cutting over, busy, or holding the boot floor: none of those flags is
 * consulted on that path. What the host then does with it is OpenCode's business, not this
 * connector's, and it is not always a new model turn. At the pinned 1.16.2, a prompt arriving while
 * the session is already running is coalesced into the run in flight rather than starting a second
 * one, which is the same COALESCE behaviour `busy` exists to avoid provoking.
 *
 * Read every ordering and precedence claim in this file with that scope: they are claims about
 * connector-submitted turns against each other, not about the host's turns. Where a specific
 * comment says "connector-submitted" it is inheriting this paragraph, not adding a new caveat.
 * Refusing or deferring native submission is separate work, tracked in #687.

   * the methods it calls. Tracking a list of the agent's presence-writing METHODS instead would be
   * the same enumeration this file has already got wrong twice, and it would miss a tool that sends
   * rather than publishes, which no amount of repairing presence afterwards can take back.
   *
   * THE PROMPT HOOK'S MODEL RECORD IS TRACKED TOO, at its own call site, because it publishes
   * presence without passing through this helper. An earlier version left it out and argued it was
   * harmless: it cannot choose a status, it republishes whichever one the endpoint holds, and its
   * record is submitted before departure's, so departure is the later write. That conclusion may
   * well be right, but it rests on how the endpoint's KV writes are ordered, which is an assumption
   * about a layer this file does not own. Tracking it costs one call and makes the ordering true by
   * construction, so nothing here depends on that assumption being correct.
   *
   * WHICH LEAVES A WEAKER PROPERTY THAN THE FENCE HAS, and the difference is worth being plain
   * about. Admission is closed by MEMBERSHIP: a door is fenced by being in the intake table, so one
   * added later cannot be forgotten. Presence tracking is by CALL SITE: these three are every place
   * this plugin writes presence today, and a fourth added later would not be covered automatically.
   *
   * EVENT WORK IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE. A session create awaits its whole swap, drain included,
   * so waiting on it before publishing departure would queue offline behind exactly the drain that
   * ordering exists to get in front of. The swap chain and the holder are joined AFTER offline, as
   * before; this set is only ever one round trip or one tool call deep.

  /**
   * THE ONE TEARDOWN, because there are two ways out and an invariant that holds on one of them
   * is not an invariant. `dispose` is the editor unloading the plugin; `shutdown` is the manager
   * stopping a supervised seat over the control socket, which is the path a managed agent
   * actually takes. Both must give the event work a bounded chance to settle before the process
   * stops, so that wait lives here and neither caller owns a copy of it.
   *
   * A queued swap still holds a drain that flushes and closes a run, and it runs on its own chain
   * rather than on this one, so without waiting for it a stop can be followed by frames for a session
   * the process no longer serves. The bounded wait REDUCES that exposure rather than removing it: a
   * drain that outlives the bound is released and the same frames can still follow. Serializing the
   * swap did not create the exposure but it does lengthen it, because drains that used to overlap now
   * WAIT one after another, and only those settling inside the bound also finish in that order, since
   * one that outlives it keeps running while the next begins. So this wait is this change's own debt
   * rather than a courtesy. Bounded for the same reason the drain is: a
   * teardown that waits forever on a drain is a worse outcome than one that says it gave up.
   *
   * LEAVING THE MESH COMES FIRST, AND THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT. A supervised stop is
   * followed by a hard kill after the runtime's grace window, which is 3s for the built-in pty
   * runtime and 1.5s for the tmux and cmux ones. The join is bounded far above that on purpose,
   * because a backstop near normal latency would fire on healthy drains and release them early
   * rather than let them finish, and nothing here cancels what it releases,
   * so this routine can be killed part way through and that is expected. What must NOT depend on
   * finishing is the cheap step: publishing offline presence. Behind the join it is lost whenever a
   * drain outlives the grace window; in front of it, it lands unless the kill arrives first, and the
   * queued work then gets whatever time the runtime allows. It used to say ALWAYS lands, which the
   * bounded intake wait added later made untrue: that wait sits in front of this publish, so a kill
   * inside it takes the publish with it.
   *
   * WHAT THAT BUYS IS DELIBERATELY UNDERSTATED HERE. Departure becomes an EXPLICIT publish ATTEMPT
   * rather than something a reader has to infer, and that is the whole of the claim. It is NOT that a stale
   * live entry would otherwise survive: losing the connection purges the presence record on its own,
   * so that outcome is not this ordering's to take credit for. A cell built to grade the difference
   * passed with the order reversed, twice, which is how the overclaim was caught rather than shipped.
   *
   * So this is best effort by construction, and says so rather than claiming the work completes.
   * The endpoint stays up until `agent.stop()`, so a drain that finishes BEFORE that still publishes.
   * One that outlived the swap bound can finish after it instead, and then it has no endpoint left
   * to publish through.
   *
   * THE EVENT JOIN IS A `close`, NOT A BARE SETTLE, AND THE TWO JOINS STAY ADJACENT BELOW. It waits
   * on exactly the chain the settle waited on, under exactly the same bound, so the join is
   * unchanged; what it adds is the refusal, so a hook arriving while this wait is outstanding no
   * longer starts or pumps an emitter the teardown has already decided it is done with. This
   * paragraph is here rather than between the two calls because a mutation anchor may not span a
   * comment: an anchor that did would stop matching the day someone reworded it, and then report a
   * clean pass over a guard it no longer tests. The two calls are one anchor, so the prose that
   * explains them lives above the routine.
   *
   * THE PRINCIPAL LOCK GOES BACK ON THE LINE AFTER THEM, and this is the only place it does. A
   * lock is per PRINCIPAL while a holder is per THREAD, so a `/new` must keep it for the session
   * that follows; only the final teardown may hand it back. Both ways out reach this routine, so a
   * dispose that leaves its host process alive releases it exactly as a supervised stop does. That
   * was the reachable failure: the lock was taken and never released, so its record went on naming
   * a pid that was alive and no longer publishing, and a replacement process for this principal was
   * refused its own event plane.

   * at the end of this comment, not every window of any width.
   *
   * The ambient id and the holder that serves it are two variables, and every attempt to ORDER them

   * still bound to the OLD thread, whose re-adopt refusal is terminal and takes the plane down.
   * Ordering a two-variable race only moves its boundary, so this stops trusting the ambient id
   * ALONE. It remains an input and stays decisional: `eventsFor` below compares it to the holder's
   * own `path`, and a foreign id routes to nothing. What changed is that agreement with the holder's
   * binding is now required, so an event reaches the holder only if that holder is ALREADY bound to
   * its thread, or is not bound to anything yet and is free to take it. A holder bound elsewhere is not the route
   * for this event, whatever the ambient id currently says.
   *
   * THIS IS NOT ATOMIC WITH BINDING, and does not need to be. `flush` enqueues, and the binding is
   * taken on the holder's own chain, so two calls in one synchronous block could both read an
   * unbound holder and the second would be refused terminally. Nothing here would stop that. What

   * variable holding one value, so two events present the SAME path and a repeat for one path is
   * allowed rather than refused; the one site fed an event-carried id today is the swap's adopt,
   * which is serialized on the swap chain. Like the presence tracking above, that is coverage by

   * EVERY WAY IN THROUGH THIS HOOK TABLE, FENCED BY MEMBERSHIP IN IT. The tool map is intake too, it

   * hook republishes presence over the offline record `quiesce` exists to publish, a part or idle
   * enqueues holder work after the join has already snapshotted it, and a late `session.created`
   * extends the very chain the join is waiting on.
   *
   * The refusal is applied by CONSTRUCTION rather than written at each entry, because writing it at
   * each entry is the mistake this file has now made twice: the guard was correct for every caller
   * that had been listed, and the list was mistaken for the property. A hook is fenced here by being
   * in this table, so a door added later cannot be forgotten, and there is no per-entry line for a
   * refactor to drop. `dispose` is deliberately NOT in it, being the teardown itself.
   *
   * BOUNDED, NOT ABSOLUTE, IN TWO DIRECTIONS. It closes ADMISSION, not the work already inside a
   * hook when the flag flips; that work is what the joins in `quiesce` cover, and a hook that had
   * already passed this point still runs. The two together are the claim, and neither is it alone.
   *
   * AND IT FENCES THIS CONNECTOR, NOT THE EDITOR. `@opencode-ai/plugin`'s `index.d.ts` types
   * `chat.message` as `(input, output: { message; parts }) => Promise<void>`. A fenced hook
   * returning early is that hook completing, and the `output` it was handed names no cancel and no
   * skip, so this table does not stop a prompt submitted through the editor. Two hooks in that same
   * file are handed one: `permission.ask` gets `status`, and `experimental.compaction.autocontinue`
   * gets `enabled`, its doc comment saying `false` skips the synthetic continue turn. This
   * connector implements neither. Cancelling a native turn would take the SDK's session `abort`,
   * which this teardown does not call.
   *
   * WHETHER SUCH A TURN'S EVENTS SURVIVE IS TIMING. `quiesce` calls `agent.stop()` last, after the
   * intake wait, the offline publish and the two settles, so holder work already queued when this
   * flag flipped can still settle and publish through an endpoint that is still up. Work arriving
