# Security model

> **Concept** (informative threat model) · **For:** operators and security reviewers · **Normative:** [SPEC §9](../SPEC.md#9-nats--jetstream-security-and-authorization). This page is the threat model SPEC §9 references; where the two disagree, the spec wins.

Cotal v0 provides containment and sender authenticity for peers sharing one trusted NATS
broker. It is not an end-to-end encrypted or untrusted-relay protocol. The enforcement
mechanics (profiles, ACLs, consumer confinement) are defined in
[SPEC §9](../SPEC.md#9-nats--jetstream-security-and-authorization) and
[Appendix B](../SPEC.md#appendix-b-profile-acls), explained informally in
[identity & auth](identity-and-auth.md); this page covers **who the adversaries are and
what is (not) defended**.

## Trust boundary

- One Cotal space maps to one NATS account.
- The broker, operator, account signing key holder, and any `admin` credential are trusted.
- On a per-user-auth mesh, ledger scope `admin` is the same trust grade as an `admin`
  credential: it unlocks the elevated views (the whole-space read tap, history and channel
  purges, channel-registry writes, cross-owner control), so grant it as operator authority,
  not as a convenience ([identity & auth](identity-and-auth.md)).
- Agents are not trusted to self-report sender identity, channel permissions, or DM access.

## Adversaries

Each adversary, what it can attempt, and what stops it (or why it is out of scope).

- **Compromised or malicious peer agent** (authenticated, in-space): the primary adversary.
  It cannot forge another agent's `from.id` (the subject sender, an `owner.actor` principal,
  is pinned to its connection by NATS permissions; not another owner, and not a sibling actor
  under its own owner), cannot publish to channels outside its declared allow-list, and cannot read
  another agent's DMs or another role's work queue ([SPEC §9](../SPEC.md#9-nats--jetstream-security-and-authorization)).
  It still can send well-formed hostile content to channels it is allowed on
  (see *Prompt-facing data*) and flood within its limits (see *availability* under *What v0
  does not protect*). These are **broker-enforced** guarantees and assume the peer has no host
  filesystem or process access to the account signer: the default single-host manager and container
  compositions do not isolate the signer from a same-uid agent, which could then mint `admin` and
  read any DM. Isolating it is a hosted-composition concern (see [Embedding Cotal](embedding.md) and
  [Deploy](deploy.md)).
- **Buggy or lazy receiver:** sender authenticity depends on the receiver enforcing the
  `from.id`-equals-subject-sender check; a client that skips it accepts spoofed senders. The
  check is therefore normative: receivers MUST reject on mismatch
  ([SPEC §5](../SPEC.md#5-envelopes), [§12](../SPEC.md#12-conformance)).
- **On-path network attacker** (between an agent and the broker): defeated only when the join
  link uses `cotals://` (TLS **required** — client refuses if the broker is not TLS). Plain
  `cotal://` does **not** require TLS: a NATS client may still auto-upgrade against an honest
  TLS broker, but a forged plaintext `INFO` can strip the upgrade and harvest credentials. Use
  plain `cotal://` only on trusted networks and in dev.
- **Content author targeting a reading model:** any writer of channel `description` /
  `instructions`, presence `activity`, message bodies, or free-form metadata can attempt
  prompt injection against an agent that reads it. See *Prompt-facing data*.
- **Untrusted broker, relay, operator, or admin:** out of scope by definition. The broker and
  any `admin` credential can read, drop, replay, or alter all plaintext traffic. v0 makes no
  claim against a hostile broker; signed envelopes and untrusted-relay bindings are reserved
  for a later version ([roadmap](roadmap.md)).

## What v0 protects

The guarantees, at a glance, each enforced by the broker per
[SPEC §9](../SPEC.md#9-nats--jetstream-security-and-authorization):

- **Sender authenticity**: the sender id is encoded in the subject and enforced by NATS
  permissions; receivers reject payloads whose `from.id` mismatches.
- **Space containment**: account boundaries isolate one space's subjects, streams, and KV
  buckets from another.
- **Channel publish scope**: posting only as self, only to declared `allowPublish`
  channels (default-deny).
- **Channel read scope**, reads bounded to the `allowSubscribe` ACL: live joins are
  broker-refused outside it, and history reads ride server-pinned single-channel consumers.
  - **Known metadata leak (not content):** agents hold `STREAM.INFO` on the chat stream, so
    a `subjects_filter` query can enumerate retained chat *subjects* (channel names, sender
    ids, per-subject counts) including channels outside `allowSubscribe`. This is metadata,
    never message content, and channel *names* are already public via the registry. Hiding
    even the existence/volume of other channels requires the per-channel-stream model and is
    deferred strict-containment work ([roadmap](roadmap.md)).
- **DM / task peer confidentiality**: per-identity inbox prefixes plus
  provisioner-created bind-only consumers, so an agent cannot read someone else's inbox or
  steal another role's work; durable-channel backstop reads are re-authorized by a trusted
  reader ([delivery daemon](delivery-daemon.md)).
- **Consumer-delivery confinement**: public presence/channel watches are lifecycle-named push
  consumers created by the ephemeral provisioner with a fixed lifecycle-owned delivery subject.
  Agents receive only exact bind/ack/delete and subscribe grants—never consumer create or pull
  delivery—so JetStream cannot be used as a confused deputy to relay their allowed KV writes onto
  another principal's private inbox. For interactive user actors, the auth service performs that
  trusted ensure before returning a bearer and preserves an already-canonical live watcher.
- **Transport secrecy (optional)**: `cotals://` enforces TLS for the hop to the broker.
  It protects that hop, not the broker itself.

## What v0 does not protect

- **Untrusted broker or relay:** the broker can read, drop, replay, or alter plaintext
  traffic. Signed envelopes are reserved for a later version.
- **End-to-end secrecy:** DMs are plaintext to the broker and to `admin`. Cotal v0
  deliberately does not add end-to-end encryption, trading secrecy for a single trusted broker.
- **Non-repudiation:** sender authenticity is broker-enforced, not portable proof. (A2A signs
  every message for this; here it is reserved as signed envelopes.)
- **Availability:** an authenticated peer can flood any channel or inbox it may write to. v0
  relies on coarse NATS account limits (connections, subscriptions, payload and storage caps)
  and adds no per-agent application-level rate limiting.
- **Replay by a peer:** a peer may re-send its own prior messages; v0 defines no protocol-level
  nonce or idempotency key. It cannot replay as another agent (subject binding still holds).
- **Static agent credential revocation:** on a static-auth mesh, a *manager-spawned* agent cred
  is now bounded (24h TTL, renewed by the manager for live agents only) and lifecycle-registered:
  despawn drives the full §13.1 retirement — its ledger rows are revoked and the manager's
  control surface refuses the retired incarnation's credential outright. What remains: within
  the TTL window a *copied* cred keeps its inline data-plane grants (static has no auth callout,
  so nothing re-checks at reconnect), and an out-of-band `cotal mint` cred is still long-lived
  until key rotation. A per-user-auth mesh closes both: short-lived bearers, ledger revocation
  that bites at the next connect, and live-connection eviction
  ([identity & auth](identity-and-auth.md)). A copied signing *seed* still stays valid until
  rotation on either kind of mesh.
- **The operator's own environment, in a spawned agent:** a managed spawn hands the child the
  operator's environment, on the reasoning that a harness they installed should behave the way it
  does in their shell, and that the alternative was Cotal maintaining a list of inference vendors.
  So an agent can read whatever sits in the shell the mesh was started from. This is a smaller change
  than it sounds: `HOME` and the config dirs were always forwarded, so an agent with a shell could
  already read `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh` and `~/.cotal` off disk, and the model key is in its process by
  necessity. It matters for secrets that exist **only** in the environment, such as an
  `aws-vault exec` or `op run` shell. `spawn.env` in the [config file](config.md) restores an
  allow-list for operators who need it; real containment is a workspace sandbox or a VM. What is
  **not** optional is the reset of Cotal's own `COTAL_*` namespace, which stops one agent's
  credential path, ACL or lifecycle uid from reaching another.
- **Manager compromise:** the operator side is split into narrow, single-purpose profiles (there
  is **no allow-all cred**); the long-lived **supervisor** serves control and touches
  presence/its lease but cannot read a DM, create a consumer, or delete a stream; the destructive
  verbs (`STREAM.DELETE`/`PURGE`, cross-agent stop, per-agent provisioning) ride ephemeral
  per-command creds (teardown / control-caller-admin / deployer / provisioner). What stays hot on
  a static-auth mesh is the account **signing key** on the mint/manager box (a compromise there
  can still mint fresh creds); on a per-user-auth mesh it is held by the auth service (the callout
  stage) and by any running manager, which self-mints its supervisor cred and renewals from it
  ([identity & auth](identity-and-auth.md)).
- **A static mesh's spawn credential is the ACL tier:** a caller that may spawn may also name the
  child's channel ACL, and on a static-auth mesh nothing attenuates that against the caller's own
  grant, because there is no ledger to attenuate against. This is the same class as the entry above
  and is not specific to any channel: the read set a spawn-capable static caller may hand its child
  covers ordinary channels, and `events.*` alongside them. A per-user-auth mesh does attenuate it:
  every delegation must sit inside the spawner's own grant, checked by NATS-pattern containment
  along the whole chain, at the grant write and again at every bearer exchange
  ([identity & auth](identity-and-auth.md)). Grant `spawn` on a static mesh as ACL authority, not
  as a narrow "add a teammate" permission.
- **`spawn` is host-launch authority:** launch options are a raw passthrough (no allow/deny
  list), so a persona holding `capabilities: [spawn]` can drive the connector's full launch
  surface on the manager host (Claude `--mcp-config`, `--add-dir`, permission flags; OpenCode
  agent-config keys). The boundary is *who* may spawn (the authenticated caller, gated by the
  capability), not *which* flags they pass. Grant `spawn` as host-launch authority, not a narrow
  "add a teammate" permission ([run a mesh](run-a-mesh.md#spawning-agents)).

## Prompt-facing data

Channel `description` and `instructions`, presence `activity`, message bodies, and free-form
metadata may reach models. Direct channel-registry writers are privileged. An authenticated agent
may supply only the bounded `description` of a new, in-ACL channel through the create-only registrar;
it cannot overwrite a card or set `instructions` through that path. Registry text is length-bounded,
but clients MUST still render all of it as attributed,
advisory data, never as trusted system instruction. This is the indirect-prompt-injection
surface common to agent protocols (MCP tool descriptions, A2A agent cards): Cotal's position is
that the reading client, not the wire, is the trust boundary for model-facing text.
