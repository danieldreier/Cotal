## The flow

`cotal setup`
([`implementations/cli/src/commands/setup.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/commands/setup.ts))
is **configure-only and state-independent**: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude Code
plugin, and seeds persona files, and it **launches nothing**: no mesh, no web dashboard, no
manager, no delivery daemon, no cmux/tmux session, no demo. Starting the stack is `cotal up`; the
dashboard is `cotal web`. Every file it writes is announced (`→ wrote …` via `provenance.wrote`).
It is two-tier, gated on a machine marker.

**First run** (no `~/.cotal/onboarded.json`, or `--full`, or `--yes`) runs `runFirstRun(yes)`:

- splash → intro → core **checks** (Node >= 22; **locate** `nats-server`: located, never
  started) → **connector picker** → write the demo personas (david/sven/me) and seed the generic
  `default` → **offer a global install** (`offerGlobalInstall`) → onboarded marker → a finale that
  lists the commands to start things (`cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn …`,
  `cotal console`, `cotal down`). Nothing is running when it returns.
- The old `--auth` / `--open` flags are **gone**: they set the mesh MODE at launch time, and setup
  no longer launches; mode is now `cotal up [--open]`'s concern (an unknown-option error names
  them, no silent no-op).

**Later runs** run `runEnsure`: re-seed the `default` persona if it's missing (announced),
re-offer the **global install** (`offerGlobalInstall`, same `isNpx()` + PATH-scan gate as first
run — so a repeat `npx cotal-ai setup` on a machine that still lacks a durable `cotal` finally
installs it), then print the **status card** (`readyCard`). The card is **read-only probes** (`machineStatus`/`meshStatus`/`webUp`/`managerUp` for NATS, the plugin, the mesh, the web
dashboard, and the manager) and for anything down it prints the exact command to start it
(`cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal supervise`). Displaying state never depends on it; setup
still launches nothing.

Steps run in-process via `runSteps`
([`lib/steps.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/steps.ts)). A step can be `optional` (asked
Y/n), carry a `confirm` consent prompt, or be `live` (it draws its own pane via
[`lib/live-window.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/live-window.ts)). On failure, an
interactive run offers a Claude handoff
([`lib/assist.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/assist.ts)).

The **connector picker** (`pickConnectors`) multiselects Claude / OpenCode (detected
pre-checked). Only **Claude** runs an install (its wake channel binds to an *installed* plugin);
**OpenCode auto-wires at spawn** (it injects its plugin via `buildLaunch`, never writing the
user's config), so the picker just marks it ready. Two experts (david, the engineer; sven, the
guide) plus the operator's own driving session (`me`) are written by default, and `me` is the
persona `cotal spawn me` drives.

**`--yes`** forces non-interactive accept-all even on a TTY: optional plus `confirm` steps run
(so the demo personas are written), the global install takes its default, and a failure aborts
with the log path and a non-zero exit. It still launches nothing. The control plane comes up with
`cotal up --detach`. This is the agent/CI contract; keep it working.

## Invariants

| Thing | Must stay in sync across | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Marketplace name **`cotal-mesh`** | `setup.ts` (materialized `marketplace.json`), `CHANNEL_REF` in [`extensions/connector-claude-code/src/extension.ts`](../extensions/connector-claude-code/src/extension.ts), repo [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) | The wake channel ref `plugin:cotal@cotal-mesh` binds by this name |
| Plugin assets | `setup.ts` copy list (`dist/mcp.cjs`, `dist/hook.cjs`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`) and the connector `package.json` `files` field | Setup materializes the plugin from `Connector.pluginRoot`; missing or renamed assets break the install |
| `Connector.pluginRoot` | [`packages/core/src/connector.ts`](../packages/core/src/connector.ts) (contract) plus set in the claude connector's `extension.ts` | How setup finds the plugin dir without importing the extension |
| `BUNDLED_PKG_PREFIX` | [`lib/nats-bin.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/nats-bin.ts) ↔ the `@eplightning/nats-server-*` `optionalDependencies` in [`implementations/cli/package.json`](../implementations/cli/package.json) | The bundled NATS binary is resolved by `${prefix}-${platform}-${arch}`. (Future: swap the prefix to our own `@cotal-ai/nats-server-*`.) |
| Onboard marker plus `ONBOARD_VERSION` | `~/.cotal/onboarded.json` in [`lib/onboard.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/onboard.ts); version const in `setup.ts` | Flips first-run vs ensure |
| Demo-agent format | `DEMO_AGENTS` in `setup.ts` matches the frontmatter shape read by [`packages/core/src/agent-file.ts`](../packages/core/src/agent-file.ts) (same as `examples/01-lateral-coordination/agents/`) | `cotal spawn <name>` loads these |
| Managed personas | each `DEMO_AGENTS` body carries a `# managed by cotal-setup` frontmatter marker; `writeDemoAgent` refreshes the file when the body changes, backing a marker-less (user-edited) file up to `<name>.md.bak` first | Edit `DEMO_AGENTS` plus re-run setup to update david/sven/me; delete the marker line to take ownership |
| `DEFAULT_SERVER` | [`packages/core/src/endpoint.ts`](../packages/core/src/endpoint.ts) | The address `cotal up` starts and the status card probes |

## Background processes (`cotal up`)

`cotal up` brings up the whole local stack in one place; since setup became configure-only
(stage 2b), this is where the mesh and control plane start, so `cotal spawn --detach` /
`cotal_spawn` find a manager right after `up`. The control plane comes up in cutover order:
old-manager preflight → **delivery daemon** (auth mode only) → **manager**, via
`ensureControlPlane`
([`lib/delivery-proc.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/delivery-proc.ts)). The detached
processes, all stopped by `cotal down`:

With no explicit `--server`, `cotal up` auto-selects a free local port when the default broker
address is already held by another root or an unrecorded broker; an explicit `--server` remains
fail-loud on collision.

- **Mesh:** `startMeshDetached`
  ([`commands/up.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/commands/up.ts)) is the one place that boots a
  background nats-server (foreground `up` and `up --detach` both route through it). Writes
  `.cotal/nats.pid` and tails `.cotal/nats.log`.
- **Delivery daemon:** `startDeliveryDetached` / `ensureDelivery`
  ([`lib/delivery-proc.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/delivery-proc.ts)) re-execs `cotal
  deliver` detached with a pre-minted scoped `delivery.creds` (auth mode only, the durable
  backstop; open mode has none). Writes `.cotal/delivery.pid` and `.cotal/delivery.log`.
- **Manager:** `startManagerDetached` / `ensureManager`
  ([`lib/manager-proc.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/manager-proc.ts)) re-execs `cotal
  supervise` detached (pty runtime); it answers the control plane
  (`cotal_spawn` / `cotal_despawn` / `cotal_persona`). Writes `.cotal/manager.log`;
  `managerUp()` checks the pid record for setup's status card. The **manager itself** writes
  `.cotal/manager.pid`, so a supervisor started by a container entrypoint, by cron, or by hand is
  recorded the same way a detached `cotal up` is. Readers verify the recorded pid is alive and is a
  supervisor before trusting it ([Config](config.md#project-cotal)).

The **web dashboard** is *not* part of `cotal up`. It and the local MCP gateway ship inside `cotal-ai`
as the `@cotal-ai/web` and `@cotal-ai/mcp` extensions and are seeded automatically by the boot reconcile
— the same durable, version-locked path as the built-in connectors (`SEEDED_EXTENSIONS`) — so they always
match the CLI version and need no separate install. Start the dashboard with `cotal web`; it records
`.cotal/web.pid`, self-registers that process with `down`, and is addressed as
`http://cotal.localhost:7799` (binds loopback; `*.localhost` resolves in Chrome/Firefox/Edge,
Safari may need plain `127.0.0.1`). `webUp()` probes the port for setup's status card.

All recorded local processes self-register `local-process` descriptors. Bare `cotal down` resolves
the full set and stops it in dependency order; `cotal down manager` (or another component name)
selects only that descriptor. Installed extensions cache their contributed registry keys, so the
base CLI does not hardcode optional package pidfiles.

All re-execs resolve this CLI via `selfArgv()` / `selfCotal()`
([`lib/self-exec.ts`](../implementations/cli/src/lib/self-exec.ts)) = `[node, ...loaderFlags,
entry]` (tsx loader in dev, compiled JS in prod), so they never need `cotal` on PATH; the stack
comes up identically via `npx`, `npm i -g`, and a dev clone.

For ergonomics only, an npx run with no global `cotal` offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai`
(`offerGlobalInstall`, pinned to the running version): gated on `isNpx()` plus a PATH scan
(`cotalOnPath()`, not `onPath("cotal")`, since `cotal --version` is not a real command). The
interactive prompt defaults to yes, the non-interactive path (`--yes` or no TTY) takes the
default, and a failed install is non-fatal (warn plus manual command). The same `self-exec.ts`
exposes `displayCmd()`, the prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` / `pnpm cotal`) used in the
status-card hints so they match how you ran it.

## Built-in extensions are seeded

The first-party connectors (`claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `hermes`, `pi`), web dashboard, and local MCP
gateway are **not** static-imported by the binary. The composition root (`bin/cotal.ts`) registers none of
them; they self-register only when imported, and they are imported only once installed. On the first real
command of each boot the CLI **seeds** them through the same `cotal ext add` path a third party uses, so they are ordinary
extensions you can `cotal ext remove`. Code lives in [`implementations/cli/src/seed/`](../implementations/cli/src/seed/);
the entry is `reconcileSeededConnectors()`, gated in `runCli` before the manifest overlay so
`ext seed --repair` survives a corrupt manifest.

**What ships where.** The connectors are `devDependencies` of `cotal-ai` (not runtime deps), and a
`prepack` step ([`bin/scripts/copy-seeded-connectors.mjs`](../bin/scripts/copy-seeded-connectors.mjs))
`npm pack`s each into `bin/seeded-connectors/<name>/` (honoring each connector's own `files`), added to
the package `files`. `SEEDED_EXTENSIONS` (`@cotal-ai/workspace`) is the shared list — the connectors,
`web`, and `mcp` — and the prepack asserts every bundled payload's `name` and `version` match the umbrella (the
`fixed` changeset group keeps them lockstep), so a version-skewed payload can never be published; `web`
also emits `dist/web/vendor/vendor-manifest.json` (name/version/license/sha512) as the auditable
inventory of its vendored browser libs (marked/DOMPurify ship as opaque `dist` bytes, not runtime deps).
`seed/paths.ts:shippedSourceDir` resolves the live `extensions/<pkg>` dir in a
source checkout and `<cotal-ai>/seeded-connectors/<name>` in a published install. The reconcile copies
that payload into the durable store `seed/store/<version>/<name>` and `ext add --install-links` reifies
the `file:` dep from THAT stable path (a volatile source would fail to re-reify); `ext add` then
junction-links each `@cotal-ai/*` peer to the binary's own copy. Before the first lazy import in each
process, materialization rechecks those links by realpath and rebinds stale links under the extension
lock. This lets the registry-facing imports of a global install, npx, and source worktrees share the
machine prefix while each process still gets its host's single `@cotal-ai/core` registry instance;
launcher artifacts are self-contained and do not resolve those mutable links later.

**Reconcile policy** (generation = the `cotal-ai` version): a never-seeded built-in is seeded; a
still-installed one WE seeded (`source: "seeded"`) is refreshed only when the version bumps (semver
compare) or under `--force`; an operator-managed official entry (a manual `ext add` at a chosen
version, no seeded marker) is left untouched on upgrade; a deliberately-removed one stays removed. The
`ever-seeded` **authority** (`seed/authority.json`, mirrored to a monotonic `.bak`) is the sole arbiter
of removed-vs-never-seeded and is unioned with its backup on read, so a truncated authority never
resurrects a removal. Every (re)install is verified before the generation stamp is written — recorded in
the manifest, present on disk with its entry file resolvable, and at the generation version — so a
version-skewed payload fails loud (`ext seed --repair`) rather than being stamped as current. A cotal
**older** than the store's stamped generation refuses before writing anything, rather than stamping the
store back down to its own version while refreshing nothing: run the newer cotal, or `ext seed --reset`
to rebuild the store for the version you are running.

**Crash safety.** One shared advisory lock ([`packages/workspace/src/advisory-lock.ts`](../packages/workspace/src/advisory-lock.ts):
atomic hard-link publish, PID + process-start liveness, bounded wait, dead-owner reclaim) guards the
whole reconcile and every `cotal ext` mutation; a live reconcile is waited on, not mistaken for a crash.
A crash **cursor** is journaled before each connector mutation and cleared only at the final commit, so
a SIGKILL mid-run is detected on the next boot (fail loud → `ext seed --repair` re-installs the
interrupted connector before it clears the evidence). Seed children are authenticated (they carry the
live lock's nonce + parent PID, not a bare env flag) and record a liveness marker so a post-crash repair
refuses to race an orphaned installer. `ext seed --reset` quarantines corrupt manifest/authority state
aside and rebuilds. See [cli.md `ext`](cli.md#ext) for the operator-facing flags.
