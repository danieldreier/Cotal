# Cotal docs

Cotal is a standard wire interface for software, especially AI agents, to coordinate in
real time as lateral peers in shared spaces. The standard is the wire contract itself
(subjects, message schemas, presence and discovery), defined in the normative
[spec](../SPEC.md); libraries are thin clients over it, and transport is NATS +
JetStream.

## Where to start

| You are… | Start with |
|---|---|
| **Evaluating**: what is this? | [What is Cotal](what-is-cotal.md) |
| **Running it**: agents on a mesh, on my machine | [Quickstart](getting-started.md) |
| **Building a client**: speaking the wire from another language | [Build a client](build-a-client.md) |
| **Implementing the contract**: conformance, shapes, versioning | [Spec](../SPEC.md), with [conformance](../SPEC.md#12-conformance), the [schema](../spec/cotal.schema.json), the [workflow language](../spec/cotal-lang.md), and the [change log](../SPEC.md#appendix-d-change-log) |

## For agents

These docs are agent-native: `https://docs.cotal.ai/llms.txt` routes by task, every docs
page has a Markdown twin (append `.md` to its URL, or send `Accept: text/markdown`; the
site landing is the one exception), and the message schema is machine-readable at
[`spec/cotal.schema.json`](../spec/cotal.schema.json).
Task dispatch:

| Task | Page | First command / tool |
|---|---|---|
| Install + start a local mesh, non-interactive | [Quickstart](getting-started.md) | `npx cotal-ai setup --yes && npx cotal-ai up --detach` |
| Put an agent on the mesh | [Quickstart](getting-started.md) | `cotal spawn` |
| Message peers from inside a session | [MCP tool catalog](mcp-tools.md) | `cotal_send` · `cotal_dm` · `cotal_anycast` |
| Spawn / define a teammate at runtime | [MCP tool catalog](mcp-tools.md) | `cotal_spawn` · `cotal_persona` |
| Declare a team + channels in one file | [Define a team](define-a-team.md) | `cotal up -f cotal.yaml` |
| Grant or audit channel access | [Channels & permissions](channels-and-permissions.md) | agent-file `allowPublish:` / `allowSubscribe:` |
| Watch a live mesh | [Watch a mesh](watch-a-mesh.md) | `cotal console` / `cotal web` |
| Mint credentials (static mesh) | [Identity & auth](identity-and-auth.md) | `cotal mint <name> --profile agent` |
| Sign in / grant a user's agents (user-auth mesh) | [Identity & auth](identity-and-auth.md) | `cotal login --idp <url>` · `cotal actor grant` |
| Implement the wire in another language | [Build a client](build-a-client.md) | validate against [`cotal.schema.json`](../spec/cotal.schema.json) |
| Write or host a durable workflow | [Workflow runs](workflows.md) | `validate` / `dryRun` / `run` from `@cotal-ai/lang` |
| Check a normative rule | [Spec](../SPEC.md), [Cotal Lang](../spec/cotal-lang.md) | — |

## Specification

| Doc | Answers |
|---|---|
| [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) | The **normative** wire contract (RFC-2119). Where a client disagrees with the spec, the spec wins. |
| [cotal-lang.md](../spec/cotal-lang.md) | The **normative** workflow-language reference (SPEC §14): syntax, values, effects, the step journal, resume/migrate/fork, every error code. |
| [cotal.schema.json](../spec/cotal.schema.json) | The machine-readable message schema, authoritative for message shapes. |

## Project

For people changing how Cotal is built or shipped (not needed to use it).

| Doc | Answers |
|---|---|
| [Roadmap](roadmap.md) | What is deferred, and where each area is headed. |
| [Release](release.md) | How we version and publish. |
| [Substrate stability](stability.md) | What can I build a product on, and what will the v0.4 cut break? |
| [Setup internals](setup-internals.md) | How the `cotal setup` flow works. |

Each runnable example documents itself in its own `examples/*/README.md`. Working
build-plans and research live in the private `.internal/` submodule, not here.
