# Embedding Cotal

> **Guide** (informative) · **For:** implementers building a service on top of Cotal · **Prereqs:** [Architecture](architecture.md), [Identity and auth](identity-and-auth.md), [Delivery daemon](delivery-daemon.md)

The `cotal` binary in this repo is one composition root: an operator CLI. A separate service
(for example a hosted, multi-tenant Cotal) does not fork this repo. It writes its **own**
composition root that depends on the published `@cotal-ai/*` packages and imports the surfaces it
wants. `bin/cotal.ts` uses the same composition pattern. This page is the contract for that: what is a real library
export you can build against, how to boot the server-side daemons from those exports, and where the
current export surface stops short of a fully hosted composition.

This is the "guarded substrate" boundary in practice. Nothing here reveals or assumes a specific
host; it documents the public seams any embedder composes.

## What you embed

The supported reference shape here is **one broker operator serving one space** (one tenant: a
dedicated data account, under an operator that also holds the system account and a quarantined
auth-callout account) plus three standalone processes. The trust layer itself composes many spaces
under one broker operator today (`createBrokerAuth` + `createSpaceAccountAuth` + N-space
`serverConfig`); what does not exist yet is the per-space **lifecycle** on a shared broker (see
[Known gaps](#hosted-composition-gaps)). The three processes:

| daemon | package | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| auth-service | `@cotal-ai/auth` | the NATS auth callout, the IdP token exchange, and JWKS. Plane 1 to Plane 2. |
| delivery | `@cotal-ai/delivery` | the Plane-3 durable backstop: fan-out writer plus trusted reader, per space. |
| supervise | `@cotal-ai/manager` | the per-machine agent lifecycle (spawn/despawn/attach), per space. |

`mint`, `deliver`, and `auth-service` expose their behavior as direct library primitives, and the
supported one-space bootstrap below re-composes from exported low-level primitives. `supervise` and
the full `up` orchestration are **not** public runners: `up` also does broker bring-up, restore,
process and registry management, and lifecycle work, and `supervise`'s orchestration is private (see
[Supervisor signing authority](#supervisor-signing-authority)).

## The export surface

Everything below is a real export of a published package, reachable from the package root (each
package publishes only `.` via `dist/index.{js,d.ts}` and ships `files: ["dist"]`). Type-only names
are marked; import them with `import type`.

**Daemon runners and lifecycle**

| symbol | package | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `runAuthService(args, store?)` | `@cotal-ai/auth` | boot the auth-service daemon; `store` injects the secret material. |
| `runDelivery(args, store?)` | `@cotal-ai/delivery` | boot the delivery daemon; `store` injects the scoped `delivery` cred. |
| `deliveryCredsKey(space, composition)`, `membershipRwCredsKey(space, composition)` | `@cotal-ai/workspace` | build the secret-store keys the delivery cred and the membership feed's rw cred are read/re-signed under. Keys are **per-space**: `space.<hex>/<kind>`. A hosted composition passes `{ injected: true }`. |
| `DELIVERY_CREDS_KIND`, `MEMBERSHIP_RW_CREDS_KIND` | `@cotal-ai/workspace` | the operator-facing KIND names (`delivery.creds`, `membership-rw.creds`) those keys are built from, and what renewal results report. A kind is **not** a key: putting a cred under the bare kind writes the pre-0.4 flat location, which nothing reads. |
| `Manager`, `ManagerOptions` *(type)* | `@cotal-ai/manager` | construct and run a supervisor in-process; `ManagerOptions.secretStore` injects the one store it reads/writes every secret through. |
| `createRuntime`, `Runtime` *(type)* | `@cotal-ai/manager` | resolve the spawn backend (pty built in). |

**Provisioning and minting** (all `@cotal-ai/core`)

| symbol | purpose |
|---|---|
| `createBrokerAuth(label)` | mint BROKER trust: the operator and system account one nats-server trusts. One per broker, shared by every space on it. |
| `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` | mint one space's own data account, signed by that broker's operator: the add-a-tenant primitive. |
| `createSpaceAuth(space)` | the one-space convenience: broker trust + one account in a single composed bundle. |
| `setupSpaceStreams({ servers, space, creds })` | create the space's JetStream streams. |
| `ensureDefaultDeliveryClass({ servers, space, creds?, deliveryClass })` | write the space's default delivery class at creation so it is wire-discoverable (SPEC section 4). |
| `serverConfig(broker, spaces, { storeDir, extraAccounts?, port?, host? })` | render the broker config: one operator, N space accounts. `storeDir` is required and `extraAccounts` preloads the auth-callout account. |
| `mintCreds(auth, identity, profile, opts?)` | mint a scoped cred for any `Profile`. |
| `mintMembershipObserverCreds`, `mintConnectionEvictorCreds` | mint the membership/eviction scoped creds. |
| `provisionAgent`, `provisionAgentDurables` | create a principal's bind-only durables. |
| `newIdentity`, `stripSpaceAuth` | a fresh nkey identity; a stripped signer bundle (data signing seed only). |
| `Profile`, `CredentialKind`, `MintOpts`, `SpaceAuth` *(types)*, `CREDENTIAL_LIFETIMES` | the profile matrix and cred lifetime policy. |

**Auth building blocks** (all `@cotal-ai/auth`)

| symbol | purpose |
|---|---|
| `createCalloutAuth`, `startAuthCallout` | the NATS auth-callout responder. |
| `createUserTokenIssuer`, `pinnedJwksResolver` | mint and verify the Cotal user bearer. |
| `createIdpBridge` | exchange a verified IdP JWT for a Cotal bearer (see [the callout contract](identity-and-auth.md#the-idp-callout-contract)). |
| `deriveOwnerToken`, `validateUserToken` | owner derivation; strict bearer validation. |
| `cotalAuthProvider` | the self-registering `auth-provider` extension. |
| `ensureCalloutAuth`/`loadCalloutAuth`, `ensureIssuer`/`loadIssuer`, `ensureOwnerSecret`/`loadOwnerSecret` | read/write the auth secret kinds through a `SecretStore`. |

**Seams and the wire** (all `@cotal-ai/core` unless noted)

| symbol | purpose |
|---|---|
| `SecretStore` *(type)* | the durable hosted-secret seam (get/put/delete); `get()` returns raw seeds/keys into process memory, so it is a blob seam, not HSM/KMS signing. |
| `FsSecretStore`, `workspaceSecretStore(root)` | the filesystem default. **These live in `@cotal-ai/workspace`, not core.** |
| `AuthProvider` *(type)*, `Connector` *(type)*, `Runtime` *(type)*, `Command` *(type)* | the extension contracts; implementations self-register on import. |
| `registry` | the shared registry a composition root pulls surfaces into. |
| `CotalEndpoint`, subjects, message types | the wire client and shapes. |
| `ParsedArgs` *(type)* | the shape the daemon runners take (see below). |

The runners take a CLI-shaped `ParsedArgs`, not a typed options object, so a host fabricates one:

```ts
const args: ParsedArgs = { values: { space, server, port: "0" }, positionals: [], raw: [] };
```

### Long-lived endpoints take a bearer function

`EndpointOptions.bearer` accepts either a string or a function, and the difference is not stylistic.
A string is minted once, so when it expires (which it will: callout bearers live minutes) the
endpoint has nothing to renew with. It will not present the dead token to the broker, since that is
a guaranteed denial that still costs a full auth-callout round trip. It refuses to reconnect, emits
`warning` saying which case it is in, and retries on a widening backoff until the process
re-authenticates and rebuilds it. Retry notices use `warning` rather than `error` because Node
rethrows an unhandled `error` event and would kill a host the endpoint is still trying to recover.

Pass a **function** for anything that outlives one bearer. That is a renewal source: it is called
ahead of each expiry and again whenever a reconnect finds the cached bearer dead, and it requires
explicit `card.owner` and `card.actor`. The first-party surfaces already do this
(`UserViewAuth.source`, the connector's `agentBearerCommand`). A string bearer is for a short
one-shot connection.

## Booting the daemons

### auth-service

`runAuthService(args, store?)` reads its provisioned long-lived secret kinds (service keys, callout
account, issuer keys, owner secret) through the injected `SecretStore`; a host provisions those into
the store first. It is a **signer and identity authority**, not a scoped daemon: at runtime it holds
the data-account and callout-account signing seeds, the issuer's private JWKs, and the
owner-derivation secret in process memory (`SecretStore.get` exports raw values). The IdP pin and the
actor ledger are **not** store-injected: `runAuthService` resolves them under
`userAuthStateDir(findCotalRoot(), space)`, a path relative to the process working directory, so a
host provisions those into that exact directory (neither `store` nor `COTAL_HOME` selects it). It
also writes an ephemeral `auth-service.json` discovery file there that carries the live exchange
capability.

```ts
import { runAuthService } from "@cotal-ai/auth";
// store implements SecretStore over your secret backend; get() returns raw seeds into memory.
// Provision the auth secret kinds into the store, AND the IdP pin + actor ledger under
// userAuthStateDir(findCotalRoot(), space), before this call.
await runAuthService(
  { values: { space, server: brokerUrl, port: "8081" }, positionals: [], raw: [] },
  store,
);
```

### delivery

`runDelivery(args, store?)` runs from a **pre-minted scoped `delivery` cred** and never loads the
signer. Provide the cred either through the injected store (under
`deliveryCredsKey(space, { injected: true })`) or with a
`--creds` file; the two are mutually exclusive. The daemon re-fetches the cred from the store at 75%
of its JWT lifetime and fails loud rather than riding to expiry, so **something must re-sign a fresh
cred into that same store**.

```ts
import { runDelivery } from "@cotal-ai/delivery";
await runDelivery({ values: { space, server: brokerUrl }, positionals: [], raw: [] }, store);
```

That renewal is a **signer** operation, not the delivery daemon's:
`remintDaemonCreds(root, space, store?, { preflight? })` (`@cotal-ai/workspace`) reads the `SpaceAuth`
signer **through the same resolved `store`** (`getSpaceAuth(store ?? workspaceSecretStore(root), space)`,
keys `auth/broker.json` + `auth/account.<key>.json`; the pre-split `auth/auth.json` monolith is
migration input and the container signer mount only) and re-signs the daemon creds (`delivery.creds` and the membership feed's
`membership-rw.creds`) back into that store. The injected `store` is both the signer source and the
credential destination, never a split. `space` is **required** and validated against the store's signer, so a
store swapped to a different space cannot re-sign over the wrong broker's creds. `preflight` is a
caller-supplied proof that the broker accepts the credential. The reference `Manager` passes a
`probeConnect` over its `servers`. It gates **every** candidate before overwriting the last-good,
whether the signer is a full bundle or a stripped projection: a bundle's JWT chain proves only that
it is self-consistent and
named the space, NOT that its account is the broker's *current* account for that space (two
`createSpaceAuth(space)` calls yield same-named, different-account chains), so a same-label alternate
signer would otherwise mint a broker-dead cred and clobber the good one. The offline local repair (`doctor auth --fix`) has no preflight. It permits the overwrite only
under **authority continuity**: the candidate must be signed by the same account signing key (`iss`) as the current
(already broker-accepted) cred. A same-label alternate account breaks continuity and is refused, full or
stripped; a legitimate local re-sign is continuous and proceeds without a network. The reference
`Manager` runs it on a schedule against its **own**
`secretStore` (see below), so passing the manager and the delivery daemon the *same* store closes the
renewal loop end-to-end on an injected backend: the manager reads the signer from the store, re-signs
into it, and the daemon adopts each generation on a preflight-proven 75% timer. It never throws: it
returns per-file results (`skipped: "no-auth"` when the store holds no signer records),
so the caller must check them or the cred still rides to expiry. A composition whose signer lives in
KMS/Vault simply injects that store; no bespoke renewal is needed. A `--creds` file path must be
replaced atomically before the 75% read. The signer can now be injected behind the store seam, which
resolves custody. The remaining hosted gap is signer **isolation**. The seed is still decrypted
in-process at the manager's uid, so it needs an OS sandbox or remote signer.

### Supervisor signing authority

`@cotal-ai/manager` exports the `Manager` class; there is **no** `runSupervise(opts)` runner. The
private CLI `runManager` also does broker-reachability checks, space/default resolution,
roster/launch parsing and materialization, installed-extension resolution, signal handling, staged
pre-spawn, and the forever wait. A host composes that lifecycle itself around `Manager`:

```ts
import { Manager } from "@cotal-ai/manager";
const mgr = new Manager({ space, servers: brokerUrl, workspaceRoot });
await mgr.start();          // then wire your own SIGINT/SIGTERM -> mgr.stop()
```

Unlike delivery, the manager is **not** a pre-minted-scoped-cred daemon (auth-service is also a
signer: it holds fewer artifacts than the full trust bundle, but its data-account signing seed still
grants complete data-account mint authority on compromise, so this is not least-privilege). On `start()`
the manager reads its space's full trust chain **through its `secretStore`** (`getSpaceAuth(this.secrets,
this.space)`, composed from `auth/broker.json` + `auth/account.<key>.json`; a container may instead
mount a stripped signer bundle at the legacy `auth/auth.json` key) and **self-mints** its supervisor cred and renewals from the
data-account signing seed. In static mode it also mints every per-agent cred from that seed; in user
mode agents instead receive callout-minted bearers, but the manager still holds the signing seed for
its own creds and renewal. So a hosted supervisor is a **trusted per-tenant account-signer process**,
not a least-privilege connect client. It additionally requires a `~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json`
registry record and the workspace user-auth marker to start in user mode. `ManagerOptions.secretStore`
injects the one `SecretStore` the manager uses for **the signer itself (the split trust
records)**, daemon-credential renewal (`remintDaemonCreds`), and per-agent secrets,
defaulting to the workspace filesystem store; pass the delivery daemon the *same* store for end-to-end
hosted renewal. The signer IS now injectable: a hosted composition injects a KMS/Vault store and no
signing seed lands on the hosted disk. What remains is signer **isolation**. The seed is decrypted
in-process at the manager's uid. That issue needs an OS sandbox or remote signer; it is no longer a
custody problem. The other knobs are `workspaceRoot` and the process-global `COTAL_HOME`.

> Scope note: the **static-auth** operator paths (`cotal spawn`/`join`/`status`/`web`, via
> `mesh-target` → `connect`/`preflight`) still read the signer from the local split records (sync
> `loadSpaceAuth`). That is the single-machine composition, where the signer is on local disk by the
> static-auth model; multi-tenant hosting runs **user mode**, which never mints from on-disk trust. The
> store-injectable signer path is the hosted-server set: the manager, `remintDaemonCreds`, and delivery.

**Signer isolation needs an OS sandbox.** The default pty runtime
runs agent children under the *same* OS uid and the *same* `workspaceRoot`, so mode-0600 on
the trust records does not stop a hostile same-uid agent from reading their absolute paths. The reference
[deploy](deploy.md) tree does not solve this: it mounts the signer into the agent's own container, so
its phase-1 boundary isolates agents from each other, not the signer from the agent. A hosted
composition must run the manager/minter that holds the signer in a different uid, container, or mount
namespace from the agent children, which mount no signer at all; that split is future
hosted-composition work, so until it (or a remote/injected minter) exists, do not run untrusted
agents under this manager.

## Provisioning a space (one-space reference shape)

```ts
import { createSpaceAuth, setupSpaceStreams, ensureDefaultDeliveryClass, mintCreds, newIdentity } from "@cotal-ai/core";
const auth = await createSpaceAuth(space);                       // trust bundle (in-memory seeds)
const provisionerCreds = await mintCreds(auth, newIdentity(), "provisioner");
await setupSpaceStreams({ servers: brokerUrl, space, creds: provisionerCreds });
// SPEC section 4: write the default delivery class at space creation so it is wire-discoverable,
// never inferred from the resolution fallback. A daemon-backed space is "durable".
await ensureDefaultDeliveryClass({ servers: brokerUrl, space, creds: provisionerCreds, deliveryClass: "durable" });
const deliveryCreds = await mintCreds(auth, newIdentity(), "delivery");
// put deliveryCreds into your SecretStore under deliveryCredsKey(space, { injected: true })
// (@cotal-ai/workspace) before booting delivery — the key is per-space, not the bare kind.
```

Rendering the broker config for a user-auth space is `serverConfig(broker, spaces, { storeDir,
extraAccounts })`, where `extraAccounts` must include the callout account from `createCalloutAuth` so
the auth-service has a broker account to answer on. That account never shares the data account.

Broker trust and space accounts are separate authorities: `createBrokerAuth` mints the one
operator + system account a broker trusts, `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` signs each
tenant's data account under it, and `serverConfig(broker, spaces, opts)` renders them all into one
config. A host composition can therefore provision several spaces on one broker today. `cotal up`
renders that config from every tenant the root's auth directory holds, so booting one space keeps
the broker trusting its siblings, and it refuses to render at all while any account record is
unreadable. The rest of the CLI lifecycle is still broker-wide: `down`, `clean` and `backup` refuse
on a multi-space root rather than scoping to one tenant, and the per-space lifecycle is the
remaining multi-space operator layer. See
[Known gaps](#hosted-composition-gaps).

## Hazardous provisioning primitives

`mintCreds`, the full `Profile`/`CredentialKind` matrix, `createSpaceAuth`, and `stripSpaceAuth` are
low-level operator primitives. Handle them as account-authority material:

- A holder of a `SpaceAuth` (or a `stripSpaceAuth` bundle, which **keeps** the data signing seed) is
  a fully-trusted tenant-account authority: it can mint `admin`, `provisioner`, and destructive
  profiles, not merely `supervisor`, and mint a DM-reading identity. `createSpaceAuth`'s full result
  holds operator, system, and account seeds in memory.
- Choose `profile` and `MintOpts` from **server-side constants**, never from tenant input. `MintOpts`
  can widen the bounded TTL defaults; cap it at your boundary. `CREDENTIAL_LIFETIMES` is a policy
  record, not an authorization boundary.
- Never log signer material or export it into env. Do not co-locate signer access with an untrusted
  connector/runtime process at the same OS uid (file permissions do not contain a same-uid reader;
  see the manager's isolation note). Segregate per tenant; rotate on compromise
  (`rotateDataAccountSigningKey`).

## Hosted composition gaps

The primitives above are present as exports, but three capabilities are **not** cleanly composable
from the public contract today. Each is tied to work in flight; a host either waits for the seam or
scopes the capability out. None is a wire concern.

1. **Delivery immediate live eviction and a fully-hosted membership feed.** The renewable
   `membership-rw.creds` is now a `SecretStore` kind. `startMembership` reads it through the
   injected store, and the manager re-signs it there. The graph-feed writer therefore renews on a hosted
   backend (its data connection adopts each generation on a preflight-proven 75% timer). What still
   reads from a fixed on-disk path are the *static* `membership-observer.creds` and
   `connection-evictor.creds` ($SYS creds, minted at the `up` that provisions the account and renewed by `up --rotate-sys`) and `membership.json`
   (`{accountId}`, non-secret config); those, plus the private provisioning wrapper, keep immediate
   live eviction and a fully-hosted feed a partial gap. Missing files degrade membership to
   traffic-only and make live eviction refuse (loudly). The supported delivery contract here is the
   Plane-3 durable backstop.
2. **Supervisor signer isolation.** `ManagerOptions.secretStore` now injects the one `SecretStore` the
   manager reads/writes every secret through, including the composed `SpaceAuth`
   signer (the split trust records), its daemon-cred renewal, and its per-agent kinds. What remains is process
   isolation: the manager still decrypts the signer in-process at its uid, so untrusted agent children
   must run under a different uid/container/mount namespace or behind a future remote signer.
3. **Per-space lifecycle on a shared broker.** The trust layer is multi-space
   (`createBrokerAuth` + `createSpaceAccountAuth` + N-space `serverConfig`, persisted as
   `broker.json` + `account.<key>.json`) and `cotal up` renders the whole tenant list, but there is
   no per-space provisioning verb and no per-space teardown/backup/restore: the CLI's broker-wide
   lifecycle verbs refuse on a multi-space root, naming the tenants.
   This is the remaining multi-space operator layer.
4. **A non-Better-Auth production IdP.** The exchange core (`createIdpBridge`) is EdDSA-generic, but
   the stock provider and login client are Better-Auth-endpoint-shaped, `cotalAuthProvider`
   self-registers on import (colliding with a host-owned provider under `resolveAuthProvider`), and
   the login flow speaks Better Auth's device-code endpoints. A different IdP is a host-built auth
   composition on the low-level primitives, not a configuration change (see
   [the IdP callout contract](identity-and-auth.md#the-idp-callout-contract)).

## Hosted durability

Space-durable **coordination** state (chat/DM/task history, live presence, membership runtime, the
durable ACL registry, leases) lives in **JetStream**, written by the delivery daemon and the
endpoints. It is broker-resident and needs no host-side durable path.

What is **not** in JetStream, and is hosting-critical, is trust and authorization state a host must
place and keep:

| state | class | where today | hosted injection |
|---|---|---|---|
| full `SpaceAuth` trust chain (`auth/broker.json` + `auth/account.<key>.json`, composed; a stripped signer bundle may instead be mounted at the legacy `auth/auth.json` key) | signing authority | `SecretStore` | `SecretStore` (manager + renewal) |
| auth kinds: callout account/creds/xkey, issuer private keys, owner-derivation secret, data-signer projection | signing/identity authority | four `SecretStore` kinds | `SecretStore` (auth-service) |
| `delivery.creds` | standing scoped cred | `SecretStore` or `--creds` | `SecretStore` (delivery) |
| actor ledger, IdP pin | authorization + trust config | ambient `userAuthStateDir(findCotalRoot(), space)` | none (root-relative; not `store`/`COTAL_HOME`) |
| `membership-rw.creds` | standing scoped cred | `SecretStore` | `SecretStore` (delivery + manager renewal) |
| membership-observer / connection-evictor creds + `membership.json` | scoped $SYS creds / config | workspace filesystem | none (see gap 1) |
| manager agent creds, actor tokens, sentinel creds | lifecycle authority | `SecretStore` | `SecretStore` (manager `secretStore`) |
| `~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json` record (holds IdP trust pins/root pointers) | non-secret, integrity-critical | machine home | process-global `COTAL_HOME` only |
| auth-health, renewal records | non-secret diagnostics | workspace filesystem | `workspaceRoot` |

The `SpaceAuth` trust chain and the auth-service store kinds are **separate** identities/projections,
never parts of one document. `auth-service.json` (the live exchange capability) is ephemeral runtime
state, not durable, but is sensitive while the daemon runs. `@cotal-ai/workspace` is machine-local
operator tooling by design; personas, PID files, and the `current-mesh` pointer are truly local and
must **not** sit on a hosted durable path. Everything classed above as an authority is what a hosted
composition must provision and persist: signer-bearing server secrets now have `SecretStore` seams;
the remaining non-injectable rows are the explicit ambient `workspaceRoot`/cwd paths above.
