# Connectors

> **Guide** (informative) · **For:** operators picking a harness · **Prereqs:** none

Every connector puts a real agent session on the mesh with the same `cotal_*` tools, presence,
and delivery model ([MCP tools](mcp-tools.md)). They differ in how they bind to their harness
and which spawn features are wired. Anything unwired **fails loud**: a flag a connector does
not support throws; nothing silently degrades.

**Native vs. bridged.** OpenCode and pi expose real plugin runtimes, so the connector runs
inside the host process; pi most directly: peer messages steer the live turn instead of
waiting for it to end. Claude Code has no in-process plugin runtime; the connector composes
three sanctioned surfaces (an MCP server for tools, lifecycle hooks for presence and delivery
at turn boundaries, and a research-preview channel that only wakes an idle session). Codex has
no plugin runtime either and its MCP client cannot wake an idle session, so the connector runs
a host-mode peer over Codex's own app-server protocol (the one the Codex TUI runs on): real
wake, mid-turn steer, and the `cotal_*` tools served from the host over a loopback MCP endpoint
— which is also what keeps them working on a turn typed into the attached Codex TUI. Hermes runs a
native plugin inside its Python gateway, bridged to the connector over a local socket; the
gateway model starts a fresh agent per inbound message, so there is no live turn to steer. Jcode's
stable Harness API is a Unix-socket NDJSON bridge: the connector starts one private instance,
creates one session, and calls its documented stdio MCP configuration from a private `JCODE_HOME`.
