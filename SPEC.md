# Cotal Wire Specification

> **Status:** Draft, v0.5 (pre-1.0). This document is the normative wire contract. Libraries
> (including the reference TypeScript implementation) are thin clients over it; where a
> client disagrees with this document, this document wins.
>
> **Layered authority.** Message *shapes* are defined by the machine-readable schema,
> [`spec/cotal.schema.json`](spec/cotal.schema.json) (§5); this document's prose defines
> *semantics*: routing, delivery guarantees, presence, authorization, and conformance. For
> the reference implementation's operator surfaces (the CLI, the `cotal_*` tools), see the
> [Reference docs](docs/README.md#reference); those describe the TypeScript implementation,
> not this contract.
>
> **Editors:** Cotal maintainers. **Last updated:** 2026-08-24. Changes are tracked in
> [Appendix D](#appendix-d-change-log); versioning rules are §11.
>
> **v0.5 binding revision: workflow runs.** A deployment MAY host **durable workflow runs**: programs
> in the Cotal workflow language ([`spec/cotal-lang.md`](spec/cotal-lang.md), normative and
> incorporated by reference) whose every effect is recorded in a per-run **step journal** so a run
> resumes on any host by re-execution against its journal (§14). The revision adds one per-space
> stream (`WFJ_<space>`, one subject per run, an append-only journal fenced by the run's own subject
> sequence), four core record kinds (`run`, `answer`, `notice`, `migration`), a per-run driver grant
> family, and the language reference; it changes no existing kind, subject, grant row or shipped
> datum, so it is **additive** under §11: a v0.4 participant that ignores §14 conforms to v0.4
> unchanged, and the advertised `protocolVersion` targets `0.5` once the v0.4 migration completes and
> the §14 plane is served. Language semantics carry their own version (`languageVersion`, pinned on
> every run record) and move independently of the wire version.
>
> **v0.3 binding revision: owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity moves from a single
> id (the connection nkey, used as the sender token everywhere) to a two-token **principal**
> `(owner, actor)` (§2): the human/account owner and the agent actor become distinct routing tokens,
> so every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>` (§3), and grants, durables, presence, and
> `from.id` re-key onto the principal (§6, §8, §9). The connection nkey survives only as the transport
> credential, keying the per-connection reply inbox `_INBOX_<connId>` (§2, §10); the wire identity and
> the connection credential are now distinct. Cross-owner **and** same-owner cross-actor forge/read
> isolation is a normative confinement property (§9). `parseSubject` splits the tokens; a well-formed
> split is necessary but not sufficient: a reader additionally rejects a non-principal owner token
> (e.g. an old-shape alias carrying a raw nkey) at the surfacing boundary (§3, §9). The owner-token
> *format* (`u_` + 26 base32-lower) is normative; its *derivation* from an owner's identity (login →
> auth callout, or another identity adapter) is a pluggable edge, not fixed by this contract. This
> supersedes the v0.2/early-v0.3 single-id grammar. As with the live-delivery revision, the advertised
> wire `protocolVersion` (§6, §11) is the migration's normative target, not a claim that every surface
> has cut over.
>
> **v0.4 binding revision: endpoint control surface.** Structured command traffic moves from the v0
> `ctl` control rail to one standardized, typed, discoverable endpoint surface (§13): class +
> instance + scatter rails with per-command broker enforcement, a versioned envelope, three
> delivery contracts (ephemeral / record / journal), normative composites (action, checkpoint,
> guard, capability handle, session), content-addressed contracts with governed traits, and
> lifecycle identity (§13.1) extending §2/§6/§8. This is an intentional **hard cut** (§11,
> §13.11): the v0 control grammar, envelope, and authority tiers are deleted, not dual-served.
> The advertised `protocolVersion` targets `0.4` at the completion of this revision's migration;
> `1.0` remains reserved as a later stability declaration, not part of this revision.
>
> **v0.3 binding revision: channel live delivery.** Channel *live* delivery moves from a single
> mediated JetStream live-tail durable (`chat_<id>`) to native core-NATS subscriptions bounded by
> `sub.allow`, with durability provided by an explicit per-channel `live`/`durable` delivery class
> (§4, §7, §8). Join/leave becomes a direct subscribe/unsubscribe with no privileged mediation,
> and channel membership moves off consumer topology to a privileged-written registry (§7). This
> supersedes the v0.2 single-durable live-tail. The reference implementation migrates additively
> (the legacy durable and the new core-sub path coexist behind `id` dedup until the legacy path is
> removed), but that migration path is not itself normative. The advertised wire `protocolVersion`
> (§6, §11) stays `0.2` until the core-sub behaviour ships; this revision is the normative target the
> migration converges to, and the additive `deliveryClass` field is backward-compatible meanwhile.

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, and OPTIONAL in
this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119)
and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174).

Sections 3 to 7 define the transport-agnostic Cotal contract. Sections 8 to 10 define
the NATS + JetStream binding (v0). A conformant deployment implements one binding; the
NATS binding is the only one defined today. External specifications this document relies on
are listed in Appendix C.

---

## 1. Scope and terminology

Cotal is a wire interface for software, especially AI agents, to coordinate in real time
as lateral peers in a shared pub/sub space, not as nodes in an orchestrator tree.

- **Space**: an isolated coordination context. One space is one tenant boundary; messages
  in one space are not visible in another. NATS binding: one space = one account.
- **Instance**: a connected participant, identified by a stable **instance id**. Also called
  an endpoint.
- **Agent node**: an instance whose `kind` is `agent`, versus a plain `endpoint` such as an
  observer, logger, or dashboard.
- **Peer**: any other instance in the same space.
- **Channel**: a named multicast topic within a space, dotted and hierarchical.
- **Service**: an anycast role reached by name (`svc`, §4).
- **Endpoint (control surface)**: a daemon that registers a service identity, publishes
  typed contracts, and serves commands on the endpoint rails (§13).
- **Broker**: the message router for a space. v0 assumes a single trusted broker.
- **Delivery message**: a multicast, unicast, or anycast `CotalMessage`.
- **Endpoint request**: a typed request/reply command addressed to an endpoint class or
  instance on the `ep` rails (§13). The v0 `ctl` control rail is deleted (§13.11).

---

## 2. Identity

An instance's wire identity is a **principal** = a pair of routing tokens `(owner, actor)`:

- **`owner`**: the account that owns the instance: the human (or organization) an agent acts on
  behalf of. In an authenticated deployment it is a derived **owner token** (`u_` followed by 26
  base32-lower characters), a namespaced, nkey-disjoint token deterministically derived from the
  owner's stable identity (e.g. an IdP subject) by the deployment's identity adapter; the wire
  contract fixes the token *format*, not the derivation mechanism, which is a pluggable edge. In open
  dev mode the owner is the literal `local`.
- **`actor`**: the instance's own handle within that owner (its agent id). Distinct actors under one
  owner are distinct principals and are confined from one another (§9), so one human's two agents
  cannot forge or read as each other.

Each token is sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9_]` (see §3) with `-` additionally reserved as the form
separator, so a principal has two unambiguous serializations: the **dot-form** `<owner>.<actor>` and
the **dash-form** `<owner>-<actor>`. The same principal MUST appear identically as: the
`AgentCard.id` (§6, dot-form), the sender tokens in subjects (§3), the message `from.id` (§5,
dot-form), the presence key (§6, dot-form), and the per-instance durable names (§8, dash-form).

**The principal is distinct from the connection credential.** In the authenticated NATS binding the
connecting user is still an Ed25519 nkey (base32, 56 chars, prefix `U`, e.g. `UAQG...`), stable for
the lifetime of the connection, but it is **not** the wire identity. The nkey authenticates the
transport and scopes only the per-connection reply inbox `_INBOX_<connId>.>` (§10); the principal
that keys every subject, grant, and durable is carried by the minted grant, not by the nkey. This
separation is what lets a login (§9) mint a fresh connection whose nkey the client never sees while
the principal stays stable across reconnects.

- A client that authenticates with a static credential MUST adopt the principal that credential's
  grant names; if a principal is also set explicitly (via the card) it MUST match, else the client
  MUST fail before publish.
- A client that authenticates through the auth callout (user mode, §9) cannot know its connection
  nkey before connecting, so it chooses its own reply-inbox nonce (`connId`) and derives its
  principal from its bearer; the broker's minted grant, not the client's self-read, is the
  boundary.
- Open dev mode MAY use `local` as the owner and an opaque stable actor, but open mode is outside
  the security claims in §9 and is not a conformant authenticated deployment.

Future binding, not v0: portable `did:key` identity plus signed envelopes so authenticity
survives an untrusted relay. See the threat model in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

## 3. Subject layout

Every wire subject is rooted at `cotal.<space>`. `<space>` and every routing token are
sanitized: any character outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` maps to `_`. Sanitization is lossy; tokens
MUST NOT be decoded back into display names.

The **sender** of every delivery is a principal (§2), carried as **two adjacent tokens**
`<owner>.<actor>`. Routed kinds (`inst`) also carry the recipient principal as two tokens.

| Purpose | Subject | Sender tokens | Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multicast | `cotal.<space>.chat.<owner>.<actor>.<channel...>` | 3–4 | §4 multicast |
| Unicast | `cotal.<space>.inst.<recipOwner>.<recipActor>.<sndOwner>.<sndActor>` | 5–6 | §4 unicast |
| Anycast | `cotal.<space>.svc.<role>.<owner>.<actor>` | 4–5 | §4 anycast |
| Endpoint rails | `cotal.<space>.ep.<one\|all\|inst\|reply>.…`, `cotal.<space>.ep<c\|e\|f\|j\|r\|t\|w\|s>.…` | see §13.2 | §13 control surface |
| Trace | `cotal.<space>.trace.<instance>` | n/a | reserved |

Token indexing is zero-based on `subject.split(".")`: `cotal` = 0, `<space>` = 1,
`<kind>` = 2. The sender principal is recovered as the dot-form `<owner>.<actor>` (= the message
`from.id`, §5), so a guard comparing `from.id` to the subject sender uses one value.

**Two-token sender, and its asymmetry.** A reader MUST locate the sender by kind:

- `chat`: sender owner at token 3, actor at token 4; the channel is everything after, tokens 5+,
  so it may be hierarchical (`team.backend`).
- `svc`: route target at token 3; sender owner at token 4, actor at token 5.
- `ep`: per-mode arities with the caller as the trailing identity tokens; §13.2 defines them.
- `inst`: recipient owner+actor at tokens 3–4; sender owner+actor at tokens 5–6.

The two-token sender is what lets a native publish grant **forge-lock** the sender suffix (e.g.
`inst.*.*.<myOwner>.<myActor>` permits a DM to anyone but only *as me*), so the broker enforces
sender authenticity and a receiver need not re-verify a payload claim. A subject that does not match
one of these shapes (wrong prefix or wrong per-kind arity) MUST be treated as having no sender and
MUST NOT be read as a delivery. `parseSubject` **splits only**: it recovers the tokens but does not
validate that `<owner>` is a well-formed owner token; trust comes from the broker's forge-locked
grant, and a reader that surfaces content additionally rejects a non-principal owner token at the
surfacing boundary (§9). Reference implementation: `parseSubject` in
`packages/core/src/subjects.ts`.

**Channel tokens.** A channel is dotted; each segment is sanitized. The literal wildcards
`*` and `>` are preserved only as whole segments for subscription and allow-list patterns;
`>` is valid only as the final segment. A publish target MUST be concrete, with no `*` or
`>`; a subscription MAY be wildcard.

**Reserved prefixes.** Application messages MUST NOT use subjects beginning with `$JS.`,
`$KV.`, `$SYS.`, `$O.`, or `_INBOX.`. (`$O.` is the Object Store data/meta subject prefix
per ADR-20, `$O.<bucket>.C.>` / `$O.<bucket>.M.>`; `OBJ_<bucket>` is a stream NAME, not a
subject prefix.)

## 4. Delivery modes

| Mode | Routing field | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| multicast | `channel` | delivered to every subscriber of the channel |
| unicast | `to` | delivered to the named instance's inbox |
| anycast | `toService` | delivered to one consumer of the named role |

Exactly one of `channel`, `to`, or `toService` MUST be set on a `CotalMessage` (§5).

**Authenticated delivery kind.** A receiver MUST derive "how was this addressed to me"
from the delivering subject kind (`chat` -> `channel`, `inst` -> `dm`, `svc` ->
`anycast`), not from payload routing fields, which are advisory. ("Delivery kind", the
addressing axis, is distinct from a channel's `live`/`durable` **delivery class**, §7.) A peer can put your id in
payload `to`, but cannot publish on your private unicast subject. Reference:
`MessageMeta.kind`.

**Delivery guarantee: `live` and `durable` classes.** Channel delivery has two classes, fixed
per channel and wire-observable (§7); the guarantee is defined here, its NATS realization is the
binding in §8. A receiver MUST derive its effective class from channel config (§7), not from
per-message metadata (`MessageMeta` need not carry it); it MUST NOT assume one class.

- **`live`** is native broker-subscription delivery and is **at-most-once**: a message reaches
  only the instances subscribed to the channel at publish time. An instance that is disconnected,
  busy, or not yet joined does not receive that message live and has no claim to the live copy
  later. There is no per-subscriber redelivery of the live copy.
- **`durable`** is `live` plus a per-subscriber durable backstop and is **at-least-once for
  current members within retention**: the message is also retained for each member and delivered on
  that member's next connection or turn, remaining pending until acked. A crash or `ack_wait` expiry
  redelivers the durable copy. At-least-once is bounded by the channel's retention / `replayWindow`
  (§7): a message evicted by retention before ack may be lost; the guarantee is not unbounded.

Unicast (`to`) and anycast (`toService`) are at-least-once via their own DM/TASK consumers (§8);
they have no channel membership and are not subject to the per-channel delivery-class mechanism. An
`@mention` (§5) on a `live` channel additionally writes a durable copy to each mentioned target
**authorized to read that channel** (its `allowSubscribe` covers the channel), so an authorized but
offline target still receives it; an `@mention` MUST NOT deliver channel content to a target outside
its read ACL. Durable mention routing resolves each lowercased name to a unique current instance id
from presence at publish time; an ambiguous (multiple live matches) or unresolvable name yields no
durable copy, and authorization is checked against the resolved id's current `allowSubscribe`. A
target authorized for a channel is **mention-reachable** there whether or not it is currently joined; this is intentional (an `@mention` can pull an authorized peer in) and is distinct
from membership; a client SHOULD distinguish "joined" (actively subscribed) from "readable /
mention-reachable" (in `allowSubscribe`) so an unjoined channel is not treated as "cannot reach me
here."

A message delivered both live and durable is **one logical delivery**: receivers MUST deduplicate
by `id` across classes (§8); the durable copy owns ack/commit; and a previously seen `id` MUST NOT
be treated as authorization for a later durable copy (for example one that arrives after a leave).
Receiver deduplication MUST NOT use the empty string as a key. Two received messages MUST NOT be
treated as one logical delivery solely because both carry `id: ""`; each otherwise-deliverable
message remains independently deliverable. Because live, backfill, and durable copies with
`id: ""` cannot be correlated by wire identity, an at-least-once path may surface the same logical
message more than once. The existing §5 obligation for publishers to supply a unique string id is
unchanged. An absent or non-string id remains a malformed envelope.
Receivers MUST tolerate the `live` gap and rely on the `durable` backstop for catch-up on
`durable` channels. Malformed JSON, spoofed sender payloads, and unparseable delivery subjects are
permanent anomalies and MUST be terminated, not retried.

**Ordering.** Cotal does not define global ordering across modes, channels, or consumers.
Implementations MUST NOT depend on cross-subject ordering. Per-consumer delivery is ordered
by the backing stream except where redelivery or explicit backfill interleaves older
messages.

## 5. Envelopes

Delivery messages are UTF-8 JSON objects with this shape (`CotalMessage`):

| Field | Type | Req | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | MUST | unique message id; NATS binding also uses it as `Nats-Msg-Id` |
| `ts` | number | MUST | epoch ms |
| `space` | string | MUST | space name |
| `from` | `EndpointRef` | MUST | `{ id, name, role? }` |
| `channel` | string | one-of | multicast target |
| `to` | string | one-of | unicast target instance id |
| `toService` | string | one-of | anycast target role |
| `mentions` | string[] | MAY | lowercased peer names; wakes the mentioned peer. On a `live` channel it also routes a durable copy to each mentioned target authorized to read that channel (§4); it never delivers content outside the target's read ACL and is not a routing substitute for `channel`/`to` |
| `parts` | `Part[]` | MUST | content |
| `replyTo` | string | MAY | id of the message replied to |
| `contextId` | string | MAY | thread/conversation correlation id |

`Part` is one of the three core shapes, or an extension object whose `kind` is namespaced
as described in §11:

- `{ "kind": "text", "text": string }`
- `{ "kind": "data", "data": <any JSON value> }`
- `{ "kind": "artifact", "name": string, "mediaType": string, "digest": string, "size": number }`
- `{ "kind": "<reverse-DNS extension kind>", ... }`

An `artifact` part REFERENCES bytes held outside the message. `digest` MUST be
`sha256:<lowercase hex>` over the raw bytes and is the artifact's identity; the part carries no
location, so resolution is the receiver's. `name`, `mediaType`, and `size` are the publisher's
claims: a receiver MUST NOT allocate from `size`, and MUST verify fetched bytes against `digest`
before use.

`EndpointRef` is `{ "id": string, "name": string, "role"?: string }`.

On receive, a client MUST verify `from.id` equals the subject sender (§3). On mismatch, a
missing `from`, or an unparseable delivery subject, the message MUST be rejected and never
redelivered.

Endpoint requests and replies (the control surface) use the versioned typed envelope of
§13.3 (`EndpointRequest`/`EndpointReply`); they are not Cotal delivery messages. The v0
`ControlRequest`/`ControlReply` shapes are deleted (§13.11).

Receivers MUST ignore unknown object fields. Unknown conformant extension `Part.kind` values
MUST be ignored unless the receiver explicitly supports that extension. Bare unrecognized
core-kind values are not conformant. Messages MUST fit the broker's configured maximum payload;
bytes that do not fit move out of the message and are referenced by an `artifact` part (above).
The transport that serves those bytes is not defined by this document.

**Schema.** The JSON Schema (draft-07) at
[`spec/cotal.schema.json`](spec/cotal.schema.json) is **authoritative for message shapes**:
a conformant delivery message MUST validate against it, and where this document's field
tables and the schema diverge on a shape, the schema wins. Delivery *semantics* (routing,
guarantees, rejection) are defined by this document's prose. The schema is generated from
the reference source, [`packages/core/src/types.ts`](packages/core/src/types.ts)
(`pnpm gen:schema`), and committed; the published copy lives at
`https://docs.cotal.ai/cotal.schema.json`.

**Rejection reasons.** The three permanent anomalies in §4 are terminated, never redelivered.
These reason tokens are advisory (for logs and error surfaces); the action is uniform:

| Reason | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `malformed-subject` | the delivery subject does not parse (§3) |
| `sender-mismatch` | `from` is missing, or `from.id` does not equal the subject sender (§5) |
| `malformed-json` | the payload is not valid UTF-8 JSON |

---

## 6. Presence and discovery

Presence is a per-space directory keyed by instance id. NATS binding: JetStream KV bucket
`cotal_presence_<space>` (§8).

`Presence`:

| Field | Type | Req | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `card` | `AgentCard` | MUST | identity record |
| `status` | `PresenceStatus` | MUST | `idle`, `waiting`, `working`, or `offline` |
| `activity` | string | MAY | freeform current activity |
| `attention` | `AttentionMode` | MAY | global attention mode: `open` \| `dnd` \| `focus`. Advisory observability; `open`/absent ⇒ receives everything. Reset: `open` published on `SessionStart`, removed on the offline sweep |
| `lifecycleUid` | string | MUST in auth mode from v0.4 | the current managed-lifecycle UID (§13.1); distinguishes a live instance from a same-name successor. Advisory for display; authority checks use the trusted lifecycle mapping, not presence |
| `channelModes` | `Record<string, ChannelMode>` | MAY | per-channel attention overrides (`ChannelMode` = `quiet` \| `muted`), keyed by concrete channel name. Advisory, **not** access control (the broker still authorises and delivers); a receive-side preference, reset on restart |
| `ts` | number | MUST | epoch ms of last heartbeat |

`AgentCard`:

| Field | Type | Req | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | MUST | instance id (§2) |
| `name` | string | MUST | display name |
| `kind` | `agent` or `endpoint` | MUST | participation class |
| `role` | string | MAY | service role |
| `description` | string | MAY | one-line summary |
| `tags` | string[] | MAY | capability tags |
| `skills` | `AgentSkill[]` | MAY | `{ id, name, description? }` |
| `meta` | object | MAY | free-form display metadata; reserved keys include `connector` (host harness name), `model` (pinned model), and `host` (the machine the session runs on, self-reported by that machine), all advisory only |
| `protocolVersion` | string | MUST from v0.4 | wire version spoken (§11); `"0.4"` for this revision. Advertisement is the marker at the v0.4 reachability boundary (§13.11): a participant that omits it is pre-0.4 (omission means the pre-0.4 line, where the field was optional) and MUST NOT be addressed on the `ep` rails. A change signal, not negotiation |

An instance MUST refresh its own presence entry on the heartbeat interval, default 2000 ms.
The liveness window defaults to 6000 ms. A peer whose `ts` is older than the liveness window
is considered `offline`.

Live clients MUST NOT heartbeat as `offline`. A graceful disconnect MAY publish one final
`offline` presence record. Observers MUST also derive `offline` from stale timestamps and
from KV delete/purge events. Offline peers MAY remain in local rosters for observability.
An instance MUST write only its own presence key, and the key MUST equal `card.id`.

---

## 7. Channels

A channel is addressable as soon as it is published to. Channel config is optional and lives
in the per-space registry bucket `cotal_channels_<space>`, keyed by the concrete channel
token.

An authenticated instance MAY register a new concrete channel through the server-side channel
registrar when the channel is within both its current read ACL and its mint-time read ceiling.
Registration is **create-only**: an existing channel entry MUST NOT be overwritten by this path.
The instance credential MUST NOT gain a direct channel-registry write grant; the registrar derives
the caller from the authenticated request subject, re-reads the durable ACL record, and performs the
create under its scoped host credential. Registration does not widen `allowSubscribe` or
`allowPublish`: join and publish remain independently broker-enforced. A registration MAY carry a
bounded `description`; the reference agent tool does not accept `instructions`, replay, delivery
class, defaults, update, or delete through this path.

`ChannelConfig`:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replay` | boolean | history replay-on-join; overrides the space default |
| `replayWindow` | string | backfill horizon matching `^\d+(s\|m\|h\|d)$`, e.g. `"24h"` |
| `deliveryClass` | `live` \| `durable` | per-channel delivery class (§4); overrides the space default |
| `description` | string | one-line purpose; max 200 chars |
| `instructions` | string | advisory usage text; max 2000 chars |

Space-wide defaults (`ChannelDefaults`: `replay?`, `replayWindow?`, `deliveryClass?`) live under
the reserved key `=defaults`. Effective replay is `channel.replay ?? defaults.replay ?? true`.
Effective delivery class is `channel.deliveryClass ?? defaults.deliveryClass ?? "durable"`.
`defaults.deliveryClass` MUST be written at space creation from the deployment profile
(local/self-hosted ⇒ `durable`, persistence on by default; public/web-scale ⇒ `live`, durability
opt-in per channel), so the effective default is always discoverable on the wire, never inferred
from out-of-band context. The same effective config MUST be the single source of truth for live
join, durable fan-out, history read, and membership surfacing; an implementation MUST NOT resolve
the class differently in different paths.

Join subscribes the instance to the channel; leave unsubscribes it. A join target MUST be within
the instance's read ACL (`allowSubscribe`, §9); a join outside it MUST be refused by the broker on
subscribe. A client MUST NOT publish to wildcard channels, but a wildcard read ACL (`team.>`)
authorizes subscribing to any one concrete channel under it **without enumerating channels in
advance**. In the NATS binding, join is a native `sub.allow`-bounded core subscription to the
channel subject and leave is the corresponding unsubscribe; **no privileged mediation is
required**: the broker enforces every subscribe against `sub.allow`, so an instance whose ACL
permits a channel joins and leaves it on its own, with no manager present. Open mode behaves the
same (the client subscribes directly). Leaving the last channel is permitted: under the core-sub
binding an empty subscription set subscribes to nothing (the v0.2 "empty filter subscribes to all"
hazard and its last-channel-leave refusal were artifacts of the multi-filter durable and no longer
apply). On a `durable` channel, join additionally establishes durable membership, a separate
**privileged** step: the instance requests durable membership from the server-side delivery daemon (a
durable-join command on the `delivery` endpoint, §13, carrying the channel and its captured join
cursor) and the daemon writes the membership record. This is decoupled from the live subscribe, so a self-serve live join never depends
on it: a `durable` channel still delivers live with no privileged writer present, and only its
durable backstop requires one. A locally created subscription that the
broker later refuses (the permission violation is asynchronous in the NATS binding) is NOT a
successful join: an instance MUST treat a join as effective only once the broker has accepted the
subscribe, and MUST drop the channel from its joined set on a late refusal (§12). Leave removes the
membership (see membership below).

Replay / catch-up on join:

1. Record the channel join watermark (the CHAT frontier) before the subscription is active, so
   live tail and backfill do not double-deliver.
2. Subscribe to the channel subject (`sub.allow`-bounded; §8). The live copy now flows.
3. If effective replay is on, read retained messages for that channel up to the watermark,
   through a single-channel history read bounded by the current read ACL (`allowSubscribe`, §8),
   optionally limited by `replayWindow`. History is ACL-bounded, not membership-gated: an ACL-holder
   may read a channel's retained content whether or not it is a current member (it could self-join
   and read regardless), so the confidentiality boundary here is the ACL, consistent with the live
   read.
4. Surface backfilled messages with `MessageMeta.historical = true`.
5. Deduplicate by `id` across the live tail, the backfill, and (on `durable` channels) the durable
   backstop, so a message surfaces once. Receiver deduplication MUST NOT coalesce copies solely
   because `id` is the empty string (§4).

`replay=false` is noise control, not confidentiality. CHAT history is readable only within an
instance's read ACL (`allowSubscribe`, §9); confidential content MUST use DM or anycast.

Channel membership governs **durable-delivery inclusion** (who receives fan-out copies into their
per-subscriber backstop) and is broker-known, not self-reported. It is NOT a confidentiality
boundary tighter than the read ACL: `allowSubscribe` bounds what content an instance may read (live
and history, §9), and an ACL-holder can self-join, so membership adds delivery semantics, not read
confinement. In the NATS binding, membership is a privileged-written record in the space registry
plane under a key the agent's profile cannot write (NOT the agent's presence key), carrying per-member
join/leave cursors so a publish concurrent with a join or leave orders deterministically; it is NOT
derived from consumer topology, and an agent MUST NOT self-assert its own membership. It is written by
the server-side delivery daemon in response to a durable-join command on the `delivery` endpoint
(§8, §13, Appendix B), distinct from and not required by the self-serve live subscribe. The implementation MUST re-authorize every
**durable-backstop** read of `(instance, channel, message)` against the instance's current read ACL
and membership before surfacing content, so a channel dropped from the ACL or **left** is no longer
surfaced from the backstop: **leave is a hard read boundary for the durable backstop** (it does not
revoke the ACL: an instance may still re-subscribe live, or read ACL-bounded history, within
`allowSubscribe`). Membership remains observability data for liveness/roster purposes and MUST NOT be
used as a send authorization gate.

On a `durable` channel, membership carries the member's **join cursor** (the CHAT frontier captured
at join, the same watermark used to deconflict the live tail and the backfill) and, on leave, a
**leave cursor/tombstone**. The durable backstop is at-least-once (within retention)
for messages whose stream sequence is **> the member's join cursor and ≤ its leave cursor**, where each
cursor is the CHAT frontier (the last sequence) captured at that transition; messages published before a
join or after a leave are not redelivered as durable and are reachable only via an ACL-bounded history
read (within `allowSubscribe`). A rejoin takes a new join cursor, so messages published during the gap are not durably
redelivered. A `durable` join is atomic across its two effects: the instance is durable-joined only
once BOTH the broker-confirmed live subscribe AND the membership write have succeeded, and on a late
subscribe refusal the membership record MUST be removed. If the live subscribe succeeds but durable
membership cannot be established (for example no privileged writer is present), the instance is
**`joined live` with the durable backstop unestablished**: it MUST NOT be reported as `joined durable`,
the live subscription remains active, and the durable shortfall MUST be surfaced as an exceptional
delivery state (e.g. `durable backstop unavailable`), never silently.

## 8. NATS + JetStream binding

Backing streams are created once at space setup. `STREAM.CREATE` is denied to agents in auth
mode.

| Stream | Captures | Retention | Required config |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CHAT_<space>` | `cotal.<space>.chat.>` | Limits | file storage, `max_msgs_per_subject=1000`, `discard=Old`, `allow_direct=true` |
| `DM_<space>` | `cotal.<space>.inst.>` | Limits | file storage, no Direct Get |
| `TASK_<space>` | `cotal.<space>.svc.>` | WorkQueue | file storage, no Direct Get |

Channel **live** delivery is a native core-NATS subscription to `cotal.<space>.chat.*.*.<channel>`
(wildcard sender owner+actor) bounded by `sub.allow` (§9), not a durable consumer; join/leave is the
subscribe/unsubscribe and needs no privileged mediation. The legacy v0.2 `chat_<owner>-<actor>`
live-tail durable is removed from this binding (it MAY coexist transiently during migration behind
`id` dedup, but is not part of the contract).

Durable consumers. Per-instance durables are keyed on the principal's **dash-form** `<owner>-<actor>`
(a `.` is illegal in a durable name; see §2), so a durable name-scopes to exactly one principal:

| Durable | Stream | Filter | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chathist_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>` | CHAT | one `cotal.<space>.chat.*.*.<channel>` per read | transient single-filter consumer for history reads (join-backfill / focus-recall); created per read scoped to one channel in `allowSubscribe`, then deleted; `AckNone`. History is ACL-bounded by the pinned filter, not membership-gated (§7, §9) |
| `dm_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>` | DM | `cotal.<space>.inst.<owner>.<actor>.>` | provisioner-created in auth mode at lifecycle activation; bind only; `DeliverPolicy.ByStartSequence` with `OptStartSeq = activationFrontier + 1`, where the **activation frontier** is the DM-stream's last sequence captured at activation (`0` on an empty stream, so the start is `1`): `ByStartSequence` is inclusive and the lifecycle interval is half-open, so the consumer starts strictly AFTER the frontier, never `All`, which would replay a recycled alias's history and the inactive-gap backlog; `AckExplicit`; `ack_wait=60000ms` |
| `svc_<role>` | TASK | `cotal.<space>.svc.<role>.>` | provisioner-created in auth mode; bind only; `AckExplicit`; `ack_wait=60000ms`. **Intentionally role-shared, not lifecycle-scoped**: anycast work belongs to the role, and successive holders draining one pool is the contract |

From v0.4, each lifecycle's durable state lives in the **half-open interval**
`(activationFrontier, retirementFrontier]` per stream: consumers start strictly after the
activation frontier (`OptStartSeq = frontier + 1`, table above; the frontier is captured
AFTER any inactive alias gap), and terminal retirement records the
retirement frontier before the alias is freed, so a successor lifecycle never receives the
predecessor's pending backlog nor messages published while no lifecycle was active (§13.1).

Per-instance durable names use the principal's dash-form `<owner>-<actor>` (both tokens
fail-loud-validated, not lossily sanitized), so a durable name-scopes to exactly one principal (§2).
The authenticated wire identity is the principal, not the connection nkey. From v0.4, in auth mode,
per-instance durable state is additionally **lifecycle-scoped** (§13.1): durable consumer names,
pending delivery cursors, membership rows, and ACL/ledger rows key on
`(principal, lifecycleUid)` (dash-form `<owner>-<actor>-<lifecycleUid>`), terminal retirement
records per-stream sequence cutoffs before an alias is reused, and a same-name successor
inherits none of its predecessor's pending state: its consumers start after its OWN
activation frontier (which is ≥ the predecessor's retirement cutoff), the cutoffs bound the
predecessor's interval, they are never the successor's start.

**Durable backstop (§4).** The per-subscriber durable copy is a delivery contract, not a pinned
layout: each member has a private durable store, written on publish for a `durable` channel's current
members and, for an `@mention` on a `live` channel, for each mentioned target authorized to read that
channel (its `allowSubscribe` covers it), so an authorized but offline target still receives it. The
agent holds **no content-bearing read** on this mixed store. A **trusted reader** (the server-side
delivery daemon) pulls each pending entry, re-authorizes `(instance, channel, message)` against the
member's **current read ACL** and, for `durable`-channel fan-out entries, its **membership interval**
(the message's CHAT sequence is `> joinCursor` and `≤ leaveCursor`; §7), not a current-member boolean,
so a pre-leave entry stays deliverable and a post-`leaveCursor` one does not,
and delivers each authorized copy to the member over an **at-least-once** handoff (its own
`dlv_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>` DELIVER consumer, carrying the same ack semantics, not a fire-and-forget publish). The trusted reader MUST NOT ack or
delete the backstop entry until the member has confirmed the copy was surfaced or handled (or it has
been transferred to an equivalent per-member at-least-once mechanism with the same ack semantics); on a
downstream nak, timeout, or crash before that confirmation, the entry remains pending and redelivers, so
a crash between the `dlv` handoff and the member surfacing the message cannot lose it, and `durable`
stays at-least-once end-to-end, not maybe-once. Content
for a channel dropped from the ACL, or (for a durable channel) left, is never surfaced (at-least-once for
the member within retention; **leave is a hard read boundary for the backstop**); a `live`-channel
`@mention` copy is delivered and `id`-deduped the same way. The read MUST run in this trusted component
the agent cannot bypass, because a self-bound consumer has no server-side per-message ACL/membership
filter. The store's stream/subject layout, the fan-out writer, the trusted reader, and the membership
registry are reference-implementation, not normative; a conformant deployment MAY realize the backstop
differently as long as the §4 guarantee and the §9 checks hold.

The absence of a usable receiver dedup key does not relax acknowledgement ownership: a
JetStream-consumed copy with `id: ""` that is surfaced or handled MUST be acknowledged
independently.

Publishers MUST publish channel, unicast, and anycast delivery messages through JetStream and set
the JetStream message id to `CotalMessage.id` (`Nats-Msg-Id` on the wire). A JetStream publish is
an ordinary subject publish that the stream also captures, so the same message reaches core
subscribers live (§4 `live`) and is retained for history and the durable backstop in one publish;
the publish path is unchanged from v0.2; only the live *read* moves to a core subscription.
Ack/nak/term semantics apply to JetStream-consumed copies (history, DM, anycast, and the durable
backstop): receivers MUST ack only after a message has actually been surfaced or handled, MAY nak
transient failures, and MUST term permanently invalid messages. The at-most-once `live` copy is not
acked.

History on join uses the pinned single-filter `chathist_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>` consumer create above, bounded to
`allowSubscribe`; agents are not granted unfiltered Direct Get. DM and TASK MUST NOT enable Direct Get
because it would bypass the consumer-create deny that is part of the confidentiality boundary.

KV buckets are also streams and are pre-created:

| Bucket | Holds | TTL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cotal_presence_<space>` | presence (§6) | 6000 ms |
| `cotal_channels_<space>` | channel registry (§7) | none |
| `cotal_membership_<space>` | derived channel-membership feed (below) | none |

**Derived channel-membership feed (observability).** `cotal_membership_<space>` is a per-agent
(key = `card.id`) derived view of who is subscribed to each channel: the **union** of an agent's
`live` core-subscriptions (read by a privileged daemon from the broker's connection view) and its
`durable` memberships (the members registry), each value `{ live: string[], durable: string[],
observedAt }` with `live` keeping subscription patterns (wildcards) the consumer expands at read time.
It exists so an observer can show silent readers and `live`-channel membership without a broker-admin
credential in the dashboard tier; it is written by a scoped privileged daemon and read by the
admin/observer profile only. It is **DISPLAY-ONLY and broker-derived**: it MUST NOT be an input to any
delivery, ACL, or authorization decision (authority for those stays the broker's `sub.allow` and the
members registry), and it is not part of the normative wire contract a client must implement.

## 9. NATS + JetStream security and authorization

**On by default.** A space is provisioned with decentralized JWT auth. Open unauthenticated
dev mode is available but out of scope for the security claims here. *(Informative
operator-facing views of this section: [docs/identity-and-auth.md](docs/identity-and-auth.md),
[docs/channels-and-permissions.md](docs/channels-and-permissions.md); the threat model is
[docs/security.md](docs/security.md).)*

- **Account = space, user = agent.** A space is one NATS account. The **broker's** operator signs
  the account; an account signing key mints per-agent user JWTs. A broker (one nats-server trust
  root: one operator, one system account) MAY host several spaces — one account per space, every
  account signed by that one operator. Broker trust is therefore per-broker, never per-space: a
  space owns only its own account and references the broker's operator, and rotating or replacing
  broker trust is intrinsically broker-wide - it affects every tenant on the broker at once and
  cannot be scoped to a single space.
- **Profiles are default-deny allow-lists.** Subject, stream, durable, and KV names are built
  from the same builders as §3 and §8. Exact profile shapes are in Appendix B.
- **An agent's channel scope is three concepts**, each a list of channel names or wildcard
  subtrees (`team.>`): `subscribe`, the active read set, the channels it subscribes to at boot
  (now native core subscriptions; mutable at runtime by direct subscribe/unsubscribe with no
  mediation); it MUST be a subset of `allowSubscribe`. `allowSubscribe`, the read **ACL**, the
  channels it MAY read (default = `subscribe`), minted as native `sub.allow` subscribe grants over
  `cotal.<space>.chat.*.*.<channel>` (wildcards preserved, so an open ACL needs no enumeration) and
  as the matching per-channel history-consumer create grants. `allowPublish`, the post **ACL**,
  the channels it may publish to; **default-deny** (a chat publish grant is minted only for a
  declared channel).

Every grant below is keyed on the agent's **principal** `<owner>.<actor>` (§2), except the reply
inbox, which is keyed on the **connection** `<connId>`: the connection nkey (static mode) or the
client-chosen nonce (user mode, §9). This is the one place the wire identity and the connection
credential diverge (§2): the principal keys subjects/durables/presence; the connId keys the inbox.

| Profile | Application publish | Read surface | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent` | own `chat.<owner>.<actor>.<ch>` for each `allowPublish` channel (post ACL, default-deny), `inst.*.*.<owner>.<actor>`, `svc.*.<owner>.<actor>`; endpoint request forms per minted capability (`ep.one`/`ep.all`/`ep.inst` with the capability's authz-mode/target pattern, caller triple `<owner>.<actor>.<uid>` pinned; `describe` by default; `epj` submissions for journaled capabilities; §13.9); own presence key | own `_INBOX_<connId>.>` + own endpoint reply rail (`ep.reply.*.*.*.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.*`, exact arity); channel live tail via native `sub.allow` subscriptions to `chat.*.*.<channel>` per `allowSubscribe` (wildcards preserved); presence and channel-registry KV watches, including create/info/delete of their client-managed ordered consumers on those two streams only; CHAT history via single-filter `chathist_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>` creates, one per `allowSubscribe` channel (ACL-bounded); own lifecycle-scoped `dm_…`/`svc_…` bind-only; durable backstop via own bind-only lifecycle-scoped `dlv_…` DELIVER consumer, **no** grant on the mixed pre-auth fan-out stream; granted record-key/event-topic read subtrees per capability | read bounded by `allowSubscribe`; ordered-consumer cleanup cannot delete KV records or streams; durable copies re-authorized (current ACL + membership + lifecycle) by the trusted reader before the `dlv` handoff; no Direct Get; DM/TASK/DLV create denied |
| `observer` | none | chat, CHAT history, presence, channel registry | DMs invisible |
| `admin` | none | whole space live tap plus DM history | plaintext god-view, opt-in |
| scoped host profiles | least-privilege per function | least-privilege per function | The former allow-all `manager` is **deleted**; its host duties split into scoped, single-function creds (`supervisor`, `provisioner`, `delivery`, `membership-rw`, `operator`, `purger`, `teardown`, `channel-writer`, …). No allow-all credential exists. Appendix B summarizes them; the concrete grant lists are **generated from the §13.9 ownership matrix** into `provision.ts` (the matrix is the single oracle; `provision.ts` is its artifact, Appendix B its summary). |

DM and TASK confidentiality, and the CHAT read boundary, close the leak paths:

1. Replies and pull responses ride a per-connection inbox prefix, `_INBOX_<connId>.>`, which
   `sub.allow` permits alongside the agent's channel read grants (next item) and nothing else. In user
   mode the client picks `<connId>` (a nonce) and the callout scopes the inbox to it, so a
   wildcard-inbox subscribe that would sniff peers' DM deliveries is refused. Re-authorized durable
   copies do NOT ride the inbox; they ride the agent's own lifecycle-scoped `dlv_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>` DELIVER consumer
   (item 5, §8).
2. **Channel live reads are bounded by `sub.allow`.** `allowSubscribe` is minted as native subscribe
   grants over `cotal.<space>.chat.*.*.<channel>` (wildcards preserved); the broker refuses, per
   subscribe, any channel subject outside the ACL. There is no per-channel consumer name to confine,
   so an open ACL (`team.>`, `>`) grants selective single-channel join with no enumeration and no
   read-breakout. A `>` grant is read-all chat in the space by design (credential compromise reads
   all chat), so it suits trusted/local deployments, not least privilege.
3. A consumer create on the bare/multi-filter subject is not ACL-constrainable, so the provisioner
   pre-creates `dm_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>`, `svc_<role>`, and the per-member `dlv_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>` handoff
   durables. Agents bind their own `dm_…-<uid>`/`svc_<role>`/`dlv_…-<uid>` only (never
   create); the mixed pre-auth fan-out store is read by a trusted reader, not the agent (§8, item 5).
   Those bare/multi-filter create forms are not granted to agents (default-deny), with explicit
   create-denies on `DM_<space>`, `TASK_<space>`, and the `DLV` stream; on `CHAT_<space>` the only
   consumer-create an agent holds is the pinned single-filter history create (next item), so a broad
   CHAT create-deny is intentionally absent: it would also deny that pinned create.
4. CHAT history reads are bounded to `allowSubscribe`: a consumer create on the extended subject
   `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<stream>.<name>.<filter>` carries a single filter the server pins to the
   request body, so an agent is granted exactly one such create-subject per `allowSubscribe` channel
   and can read history of no other channel. The unfiltered Direct Get grant is not given to agents.
5. **The durable backstop is read by a trusted reader, not the agent.** The agent holds no
   content-bearing read on the mixed pre-auth fan-out store; a trusted reader (the server-side delivery
   daemon) MUST re-authorize `(instance, channel, message)` against the member's current read ACL and,
   for `durable`-channel fan-out entries, its current membership, before handing the authorized
   copy off to the member's own lifecycle-scoped `dlv_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>` DELIVER consumer:
   broker ownership of an inbox ("this is agent A's") is not authorization, since the store can hold
   messages for channels A has since dropped from its ACL or left, and a self-bound consumer cannot
   filter per-message on membership. Fan-out-on-write is routing, not an authorization check; for a
   durable channel a `leave` is a hard read boundary on the backstop. History/backfill reads are instead
   self-served and bounded by the current read ACL (the pinned single-filter create above), consistent
   with the live read. An `@mention` durable copy is written only to a target authorized to read the
   channel, so `mentions` cannot carry content outside a target's read ACL.
6. **"Current read ACL" is the effective broker-accepted credential.** An ACL narrowing takes effect
   when the credential/permissions are updated and enforced by the broker (re-mint / reconnect /
   revocation), not as an instantaneous global value; until then an existing broad credential remains
   broad. Both the broker `sub.allow` checks and the trusted-reader re-checks are evaluated against that
   effective credential.

This binding provides containment and authenticity under a single trusted broker: an agent
can emit only as itself and only to its declared `allowPublish` channels, and read only its own
DMs and chat *content* within `allowSubscribe` (and, for `durable` content, its current
membership), enforced by the server. It does not provide
non-repudiation, does not survive an untrusted relay, and DMs are plaintext to the broker and
to `admin`. The read bound is on **content**, not metadata: agents hold `STREAM.INFO` on CHAT
(for the join watermark, the recall drop-marker, and channel-list counts), so a `subjects_filter`
query leaks chat subject *metadata* (channel names, sender ids, and per-subject counts) for
channels outside `allowSubscribe` (channel names are already public via the registry). Hiding
that metadata is deferred strict-containment work. See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

**Consumer-delivery confused deputy on the read grants.** A JetStream consumer delivers stored
bytes to a **caller-chosen destination the broker does NOT confine to the requester's
`pub.allow`**: a push consumer's `deliver_subject`, and a pull `MSG.NEXT`/`DIRECT.GET`
request's reply subject, are set in the request body and the server's internal client publishes
there regardless of the requester's publish permissions. The v0.3 read grants above,
CHAT-history `CONSUMER.CREATE`, the bind-only DM/DLV/TASK `MSG.NEXT`, and the KV watch creates
(Appendix B); therefore let an agent redirect content it may legitimately READ onto a subject
it may NOT publish to: e.g. replay a stored CHAT message whose `from.id` is another sender onto
`inst.<victim>.<thatSender>`, where the recipient derives the DM sender from the subject and
surfaces it as a genuine DM from a principal who never sent it. The §13.9 "Mediated reads" rule
applies here: **no untrusted agent holds a raw consumer `CREATE`/`MSG.NEXT` or `DIRECT.GET` on
`CHAT`/`DM`/`TASK`/`DLV` or the KV buckets**; those reads are served by the trusted
reader/mediator (§8) onto the agent's own confined rail. Which of these read paths require
mediation and which are provably safe depends on whether a redelivered message retains its
original captured subject and how the receiver's subject-derived kind check (§12) then
classifies it; the reference implementation determines this by test and pins the exact grants.
On the v0.3 rails without this mediation, read containment holds only against a *conforming*
client; the broker does not enforce it.
See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

## 10. Connection and onboarding

Join link grammar:

```text
cotal://[token@]host[:port]/space[?channel=a,b]      plaintext
cotals://[token@]host[:port]/space[?channel=a,b]     TLS required
cotal://user:pass@host/space                         user/password auth
```

- Default port is `4222`.
- `channel` and `channels` query parameters are equivalent comma-separated channel lists.
- Credentials in `userinfo` are parsed out and passed to the NATS client as connect options;
  they are not left inside the server URL.
- Bare `userinfo` with no `:` is a token. `user:pass` is username/password.
- `cotals://` means `nats://host:port` plus TLS-required connect options.
- Credentials (`creds`) are mutually exclusive with token and username/password auth.
- A client MUST set `inboxPrefix` to `_INBOX_<connId>` before any request, pull consumer, or KV
  watch operation, where `<connId>` is the connection identifier (the connection nkey in static
  mode; the client-chosen nonce in user mode, §2/§9), NOT the owner+actor principal, which the
  client may not know pre-connect.

Authenticated onboarding has two bindings. **Out-of-band credential minting** provisions a per-agent
credential ahead of connect (the static path). **Auth-callout onboarding** validates a user bearer at
connect time and mints the scoped data-account JWT then (user mode, §2/§10): the client presents a
deny-all sentinel credential plus its bearer, the callout derives the owner+actor principal and grants,
and re-binds the connection into the data account. The owner-token *derivation* (how a bearer maps to
an owner token) is a pluggable identity adapter (any OIDC/IdP via a thin bridge), not fixed by this
contract; the callout *mechanism* and the resulting grants are. From v0.4 every minted connection also carries its **lifecycle UID** (§13.1): the manager
mints it for managed agents at provision, and the callout/exchange attaches it as a claim at
connect for user-mode connections, so the caller-UID token in every endpoint-rail grant is
authority-assigned, never client-chosen. Every bearer additionally carries its incarnation's
**root credential id** (`act.credentialId`, §13.1). The exchange ensures the ACTIVE
`cred.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` ledger row exists BEFORE the bearer bytes are released
(the row durable first, the issuance-gate finalize CAS, the lifecycle head's current-root CAS
last), and the connect authority proves the presented id against the LIVE row, leader-served
from the shape-proved primary auth store: the row MUST be `active`, unexpired, and bound to the
connecting principal and lifecycle, and a root-issued credential MUST additionally equal the
lifecycle head's current root credential. A claimless bearer, a revoked, expired, or absent row,
and an unreadable authority store all DENY the connect. The root credential is
**incarnation-wide**: ONE `cred.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` row per incarnation, re-stamped
(the same id) on every exchange for the incarnation's lifetime, never a fresh id per exchange.
Revoking that one row is the per-credential revocation lever and denies EVERY bearer of the
incarnation at the next connect (deny-new; evicting an already-live connection is the lifecycle
barriers' job, §13.1). Because the id is incarnation-stable, a crash after the head's current-root
CAS re-exports the SAME id on the next exchange (that id IS the incarnation's live root, so there
is nothing unobserved to revoke); the only pre-release crash window is a durable active-but-
unstamped row, which the head-equality check denies. Rotating an incarnation's root credential is
exclusively a lifecycle barrier's job, never a bare re-mint. A bearer MAY carry a server-authored
**view** claim, minted only by the deployment's signed-in human exchange (never accepted from the
client or from a managed agent-secret exchange) and re-authorized against the live grant ledger at
every connect: the callout then mints the connection as the named elevated profile (Appendix B:
`admin`, or a scoped host profile such as `purger`, `channel-writer`, `deployer`) instead of `agent`.

## 11. Versioning and extensibility

- Wire contract version is v0.2 as advertised today. `AgentCard.protocolVersion` (§6) carries
  this string. The two v0.3 binding revisions (channel live delivery and owner+actor identity,
  see the header) and the **v0.4 endpoint control surface** (§13) are the normative targets the
  reference implementation is converging to. The control surface is an intentional **hard
  cut on the pre-1.0 line** (§13.11): the v0.3 control grammar and envelope are removed from
  this contract, not dual-served, a breaking revision, permitted pre-1.0, shipping under an
  explicit new version marker per this section's rule; the marker is the disjoint endpoint
  subject grammar and versioned envelope. The advertised `protocolVersion` bumps to `0.4` when
  the control-surface migration completes (one campaign, one merge); a version string is not a
  per-surface cutover claim. **`1.0` is deliberately deferred**: it is a stability declaration
  to outside implementers, made separately once the contract has settled (further pre-1.0
  arcs (presence/addressing, multi-space, federation) may still break the wire). **The wire `protocolVersion`
  is the compatibility signal**; dated document snapshots (below) are navigation artifacts, not
  negotiation; an implementation MUST NOT treat a document date as an interop key.
- **v0.5 (workflow runs, §14) is an additive revision.** It adds a per-space stream, four core
  record kinds, a per-run grant family and a normative language reference, and changes no existing
  kind, subject, grant row or shipped datum; a participant that ignores §14 conforms to v0.4
  unchanged. Two versions ride it and they are deliberately distinct: the wire `protocolVersion`,
  which targets `0.5` when the plane is served, and the language's own `languageVersion` (§14.2),
  which is bumped when a program's MEANING changes and is pinned per run, so a language revision
  never forces a wire revision and a wire revision never invalidates an open run.
- v0 has no in-band capability negotiation. Deployments MUST agree on the binding and
  version out of band. A participant advertises the version it speaks via
  `AgentCard.protocolVersion` (§6) as a one-way change signal, optional before the v0.4
  marker, MUST from v0.4 (§6, §13.11); v0 defines no behavior on a mismatch beyond rejecting
  messages it cannot parse.
- **A non-additive discovery change is an out-of-band deployment cutover, and it rolls out
  CALLER-FIRST.** A discovery change is non-additive when an unamended client that ignores it per
  the unknown-field rule below would then behave in a way the change exists to prevent — for such
  a change, ignoring is not a safe default and no default value repairs it. Every caller in a
  deployment MUST implement the new version's rules BEFORE any responder in that deployment
  registers or describes at that version. The two halves SHOULD therefore ship in **separate**
  releases — the caller side first and adopted across the deployment, the responder's emission only
  after — and shipping them in one release does not make a deployment safe, because **a release is
  not a deployment**: an already-running caller is unchanged by whatever a new artifact contains,
  so the order of two source edits says nothing about the processes on the wire. This rule exists
  because the preceding one leaves a responder no way to detect the hazard itself: with no in-band
  negotiation and no caller version on the wire, a responder cannot tell an amended caller from an
  unamended one, so the obligation rests on the deployment rather than on either participant. The
  observable marker is the discovery protocol's `protocol.v` on the registered service record
  (§13.7) — "has any responder cut over" is a checkable registry property, while "has every caller
  adopted" is exactly the out-of-band agreement this section already requires. **The residual is
  real**: a deployment that cuts a responder over early exposes its unamended callers to whatever
  the new version exists to prevent, and within v0 nothing in band detects it. Closing that needs
  negotiation v0 does not have, and the v1 marker below is where it belongs.
- New message families, subjects, and routing kinds are added in the core contract,
  generalized for all deployments, not in one example.
- Receivers MUST ignore unknown object fields and MUST NOT treat an unknown field as an
  error.
- A future v1 MUST either keep v0 subjects backward-compatible or use an explicit new
  version marker in subjects, credentials, or deployment config.

**Document snapshots.** Published revisions of this document are dated snapshots
(`YYYY-MM-DD`, the **Last updated** date above): the current revision is canonical, and a
superseded one stays retrievable from the repository history (the git history and tagged
releases of `SPEC.md`), so a client built against it can still be audited. The snapshot
date advances on any normative change; the wire `protocolVersion` moves only per the
change process below.

**Change process.** This document is the change-control point: a change lands here first,
generalized into `core`, and the reference implementation follows. Additive changes (a new
optional field, a new namespaced `Part.kind`, a new subject) are backward-compatible and ship as
a minor bump, since receivers ignore what they do not recognize. Changing the meaning of an
existing field or subject, or removing or renaming one, is breaking. **Pre-1.0**, a breaking
change ships as a minor bump of the v0.x line under an explicit new version marker in
subjects, credentials, or deployment config (the v0.4 endpoint grammar is such a marker);
**post-1.0**, it ships as a major bump. `1.0` itself is a stability declaration, made
deliberately and separately from any wire change.

**Extension namespacing.** Core `Part.kind` values, `meta` keys, and `tags` are bare and reserved
to this spec (`text`, `data`, `artifact`, and future core additions). A non-core extension MUST namespace its
custom `Part.kind` values and `meta` keys reverse-DNS, under a domain its author controls, e.g.
`{ "kind": "com.acme.snapshot" }` or `meta["com.acme.region"]`; Cotal's own non-core extensions
use `ai.cotal.*`. This keeps third-party names from colliding with each other or with future core
names, with no central registry.

Reserved future work: signed envelopes, `did:key` identity, auth-callout bootstrap tokens,
manager profile scoping, and federated/untrusted relay bindings. (Revocation/TTL for minted credentials is no longer future work on the control
surface: v0.4 defines it normatively via the credential ledger and the lifecycle barriers,
§13.1.)

## 12. Conformance

*(An informative build-order walkthrough of this checklist is
[docs/build-a-client.md](docs/build-a-client.md).)*

A conformant authenticated NATS client MUST:

1. Use one stable principal `<owner>.<actor>` as its wire identity everywhere: subject sender
   tokens (§3), `from.id` (§5), presence key (§6), durable names (dash-form, §8); and treat the
   connection credential (nkey) as distinct, keying only its reply inbox (§2).
2. Publish only on subjects whose sender tokens are its own principal `<owner>.<actor>` (§3).
3. Publish delivery messages as UTF-8 JSON through JetStream with `msgID = id` (§8).
4. Set exactly one routing field on each delivery message (§5).
5. Reject any received delivery message whose `from.id` does not match the subject sender, and whose
   subject `<owner>` is not a well-formed principal owner token: a subject that split-parses but
   carries a non-owner in the owner slot (e.g. a raw nkey, an old-shape alias) MUST NOT be surfaced
   as a delivery (§3, §5).
6. Derive delivery kind (channel/dm/anycast) from the subject, not payload routing fields (§4).
7. Ack only surfaced/handled messages and terminate permanent anomalies (§4, §8).
8. Write only its own presence key on the heartbeat interval (§6).
9. Set the per-instance inbox prefix before transport operations (§10).
10. Treat unknown fields as ignorable (§11).
11. Resolve a channel's effective delivery class (`live`/`durable`) from channel config, not from a
    deployment assumption, and use one resolution across live join, durable fan-out, history read,
    and membership surfacing (§4, §7).
12. On a `durable` channel, tolerate the at-most-once `live` gap and catch up via the durable
    backstop; deduplicate by `id` across the live, backfill, and durable copies (§4, §8). Receiver
    deduplication MUST NOT coalesce copies solely because `id` is the empty string (§4).
13. Join and leave a channel's **live** subscription by subscribing/unsubscribing under `sub.allow`
    with no privileged mediation; treat a live join as effective only once the broker accepts the
    subscribe, and drop it on a late permission refusal. On a `durable` channel, additionally establish
    durable membership via the privileged provisioner; if it cannot be established, report `joined live`
    with the durable backstop unestablished, never `joined durable` (§7, §9).
14. Bound history/backfill reads by the current read ACL, and re-authorize every durable-backstop read
    against the current read ACL (and, for `durable`-channel entries, membership) before surfacing
    content, treating a leave as a hard read boundary on the backstop (§7, §9).

Test vectors use these sample principals (`<owner>.<actor>`); `<ownerA>` = `u_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`,
`<ownerB>` = `u_bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb` (owner tokens are `u_` + 26 base32-lower, §2):

- Alice: `<ownerA>.alice`
- Bob: `<ownerB>.bob`
- Reviewer role: `reviewer`

Subject parsing. `parseSubject` **splits only** (§3): it recovers tokens by prefix and per-kind arity
but does NOT validate the owner token: a well-formed *split* is necessary, not sufficient, for a
subject to be surfaced as a delivery. The last row shows an old-shape alias that split-parses yet MUST
be dropped at the surfacing boundary (§9):

| Subject | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cotal.main.chat.<ownerA>.alice.team.backend` | `kind=chat`, `sender=<ownerA>.alice`, `rest=team.backend` |
| `cotal.main.inst.<ownerB>.bob.<ownerA>.alice` | `kind=inst`, `sender=<ownerA>.alice`, `rest=<ownerB>.bob` (recipient) |
| `cotal.main.svc.reviewer.<ownerA>.alice` | `kind=svc`, `sender=<ownerA>.alice`, `rest=reviewer` |
| `cotal.main.ctl.manager.<ownerA>.alice` | no sender; v0 control subject, retired (§13.11): nothing serves it and it MUST NOT be handled |
| `cotal.main.chat.<ownerA>.alice` | no sender; malformed (owner+actor but no channel token) |
| `cotal.main.chat.UAQGWOEVJKMIO4WXSYOTLARXYOZTCXFK67JASEH6AFFFYK6FOPSKQCAD.team.backend` | split-parses (`kind=chat`, `owner=UAQ...QCAD`, `actor=team`, `rest=backend`) but MUST be dropped: `UAQ...QCAD` is not a principal owner token (§3, §9) |

Sample multicast message:

```json
{
  "id": "018f1d0a-0000-7000-9000-000000000001",
  "ts": 1710000000000,
  "space": "main",
  "from": {
    "id": "u_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.alice",
    "name": "alice",
    "role": "planner"
  },
  "channel": "team.backend",
  "mentions": ["bob"],
  "parts": [{ "kind": "text", "text": "Can you review this?" }],
  "contextId": "ctx-1"
}
```

Sample unicast message changes only the routing field:

```json
{
  "id": "018f1d0a-0000-7000-9000-000000000002",
  "ts": 1710000001000,
  "space": "main",
  "from": {
    "id": "u_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.alice",
    "name": "alice"
  },
  "to": "u_bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.bob",
  "parts": [{ "kind": "text", "text": "Direct note." }]
}
```

Interop scenario:

1. Provision a space and credentials for Alice and Bob.
2. Alice and Bob connect with inbox prefixes `_INBOX_<connId>` (per-connection, §2).
3. Both write presence and join `team.backend`.
4. Alice multicasts on `team.backend`; Bob receives with `kind=channel`.
5. Alice unicasts to Bob; Bob receives with `kind=dm`.
6. Alice anycasts to `reviewer`; exactly one reviewer receives with `kind=anycast`.
7. A late joiner joins `team.backend`; replayed messages arrive with `historical=true` and
   live-tail duplicates at or below the join watermark are ack-dropped.

---

## 13. Endpoint control surface (v0.4)

Everything on the mesh that serves structured commands (the manager daemon, the delivery
daemon, a wrapped MCP server, a third-party service) is an **endpoint**: a daemon that
registers a service identity, publishes its contracts, and answers `describe`. There is no
special-cased service in this contract: `manager` and `delivery` are endpoint names like any
other, and no subject or envelope in this section knows them. This section supersedes and
**deletes** the v0 control rail (`ctl.<service>.<owner>.<actor>`, `ControlRequest`/
`ControlReply`, the `self`/`manager`/`admin`/`delivery`/`delivery-admin` service tiers, and the
reserved `control.<instance>` subject). The cut is hard (§13.11): no v0 control subject,
envelope, handler, or grant survives, and a pre-cut control credential cannot reach a post-cut handler.

Layering: identity and transport are §2/§3, extended by the lifecycle identity below; §13.1
identity; §13.2 grammar; §13.3 envelope; §13.4 delivery contracts; §13.5 verbs; §13.6
composites; §13.7 contracts and discovery; §13.8 distributed guarantees; §13.9 authority
boundary; §13.10 receipts and signing anchors; §13.11 the hard cut; §13.12 the NATS binding;
§13.13 plane ownership; §13.14 conformance.

### 13.1 Lifecycle identity

The principal `owner.actor` (§2) is a **recyclable routing alias**: despawning an agent frees
its actor name, and a later spawn may legitimately reuse it. An alias is therefore never
sufficient *authority* identity on this surface. Two further identity components exist:

- **Lifecycle UID** (`lifecycleUid`, one token `[a-z0-9]{26,32}`, ≥128 bits of CSPRNG
  entropy in a fixed canonical encoding): an unguessable, never-reused
  identifier of one managed lifecycle under a principal. The UID is entropy, never order:
  no allocator counter exists, and what is durable and monotonic is only the never-used
  set. Before anything else, the minting authority (the manager for managed agents; the
  provisioner for endpoint daemons and operator credentials) **reserves the candidate UID
  space-globally**: a create-only write of the reservation key `uid.<lifecycleUid>`
  (§13.7), never deleted for the life of the space. A create conflict burns the candidate
  and draws a fresh one (the alias head alone cannot reject the same UID under a different
  alias, and the `gate.`/`cred.` families key by UID alone, so uniqueness must be
  space-wide); a DEL/PURGE marker on a reservation is corruption, never reusable absence.
  Only then does it mint **before the entity is reachable**, persisting a CAS-fenced
  mapping
  `{ owner, actor, lifecycleUid, managerInstance, processEpoch,
  state: active | retiring | retired, currentCredentialId?, lastTakeoverOpId?, op? }` (closed
  schema; the
  embedded `owner`/`actor` MUST equal the key's alias tokens, so a key-mismatched row
  never authorizes; `currentCredentialId` is absent until the credential ledger releases
  a root under the reopened gate; `lastTakeoverOpId` is the opId of the takeover operation
  that LAST advanced `processEpoch` (the epoch advance and this stamp are ONE head CAS, so a
  completion is bound to exactly one operation: a resuming barrier confirms the completed head
  carries ITS opId, and a LOSING concurrent takeover that captured the same pre-takeover
  coordinates finds a foreign opId and refuses, never claiming the winner's completion; absent
  until the first takeover); `op` is required at `retiring` and forbidden elsewhere)
  under the alias's **CAS head key** (§13.7:
  the **unsplit** `lifecycle.<owner>.<actor>` head key HOLDS this mapping as one atomic
  record, the single authoritative current mapping and the only source of `mappingRevision`,
  §13.9; the UID-suffixed `lifecycle.<owner>.<actor>.<lifecycleUid>` key is optional
  append-only audit, never the authority). `mappingRevision` IS the head key's store
  revision, learned from the publish ack or from the leader-served read that returned the
  mapping (one read returns `{ mapping, revision }`); the value carries NO revision field,
  and a body-supplied revision is never a CAS coordinate. Head states: `active` is the
  ONLY current state. `retiring` is the containment phase of the terminal barrier (below),
  bound to the retirement operation's `op.opId`; it is non-current and NOT replaceable.
  `retired` is terminal and asserts the barrier COMPLETED (the cleanup proof), which is
  what makes replacing a retired predecessor safe. **Every currency seam fails closed on
  both non-`active` states**: target resolution, the process-epoch reads gating
  record/status writes, admission/start, and supervision derive current authority only
  from `state: "active"`; `retiring` and `retired` alike yield no current mapping and no
  current epoch. Activation is the head CAS (create-only for a virgin alias;
  revision-pinned from a `retired` predecessor), so two concurrent mints for one alias
  serialize there and exactly one activates; the loser terminalizes its own orphan gate
  and burns its reserved UID, never deleting either (`currentCredentialId` is a public key
  identifier/fingerprint plus authority epoch, never secret material). A supervised restart
  of the same entity **preserves**
  the UID (revoking/rotating the connection credential and advancing the process epoch); a
  terminal despawn, explicit stop, or supervision escalation retires the UID through the
  terminal barrier *before* the alias is freed. A retired UID is never reactivated
  (`retired → active` for the SAME UID is forbidden; only the ALIAS is replaceable, by a
  freshly reserved UID); recycling cannot move to the reservation, which is never freed.
- **Process epoch** (`incarnation`, an unsigned integer): the fenced ownership epoch of the
  process currently animating an identity, advanced by CAS on every takeover or restart. At
  most one live epoch owns an identity; a superseded process MUST stop serving and its commits
  are rejected (§13.8). **The epoch fences egress only**: reply, event, timer, session, and
  record-write-ingress publish grants pin it (§13.9), but request subjects deliberately omit it; a caller cannot
  know the serving epoch, so **no subject-level fence for ingress exists or can exist**. An
  un-revoked superseded serve credential remains a member of the class queue group and can
  consume (and externally effect, and never validly answer) one call in N. Takeover therefore
  carries a **normative barrier, in order**: freeze issuance for
  the lifecycle in the credential ledger (below) → revoke EVERY active credential-ledger
  row under the lifecycle prefix, every root (the superseded `currentCredentialId` and any
  earlier unexpired root: each root mint, initial or rotation, writes its own ledger row)
  and every ledgered descendant (handle-redemption-minted and per-session credentials,
  §13.6), via the deployment's auth
  authority, verifying the updated revocation state is enforced on EVERY server of the
  cluster before proceeding (fail-closed on partial acknowledgment: an unrevoked-anywhere
  credential can reconnect there) → evict the live connections of every revoked
  credential's `holderPrincipal` (from its ledger row, above)
  cluster-wide and verify the re-scan found none, the barrier executor (the trusted auth
  path) holds the delivery endpoint's `evictPrincipal` capability for exactly this step
  (Appendix B: granted to the barrier executor, not only `supervisor`); `evictPrincipal`:
  system-account CONNZ scan → per-server KICK → re-scan verify, fail-closed on partial
  scans; Appendix B) → **only THEN advance the process epoch by CAS (N→N+1), reopen the gate
  at the new generation, and activate the successor's serve subscription**. The epoch CAS is
  LAST, not first: a superseded process is revoked and evicted before the successor's epoch
  exists, so it cannot publish a reply or event in a window between the CAS and the eviction;
  the egress epoch is honest attribution precisely because no live predecessor egress survives
  the barrier. (A reply the predecessor emitted for an in-flight call before eviction reaches
  a caller only within that caller's own deadline and from a not-yet-evicted process; the
  barrier's job is that no such process remains once the successor answers.) Where
  revocation or verified eviction is unavailable (e.g. static credential material
  pre-rotation, Appendix B), takeover MUST fail loud rather than proceed.

**Credential ledger (normative).** Ingress has no epoch fence, so revocation is only as
complete as the set of credentials it covers, and the lifecycle's `currentCredentialId` is
not that set. Every credential the trusted auth path mints **derived from** a lifecycle (the
short-lived credential of a handle redemption, the two per-session credentials of a session
redemption, §13.6) is recorded at mint time in a durable, auth-owned **credential ledger**
row `{ credentialId, holderPrincipal (the `<owner>.<actor>` whose connections the barrier evicts; the credential id is NOT the principal, and eviction is by principal), lifecycleUid (the holder's), sourceChain: [root |
handle.<issuerKeyId>.<id>… | session.<sessionId>], the FULL verified lineage: for a
handle redemption, EVERY handle in the presented `parentDigest` chain (§13.6), never only
the leaf, state: active | revoked (monotonic), exp }`, keyed
`cred.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` so both barriers enumerate a lifecycle's full descendant
family by key prefix. Each mint additionally writes one reverse-index key
`bysrc.<issuerKeyId>.<id>.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` per chain member, so **revoking a
sturdy handle revokes every credential minted under it or under any of its descendant
handles**; a credential redeemed through a child handle carries the parent in its
`sourceChain`/`bysrc` keys, so parent revocation reaches it without walking handle records.
**Source gates.** The same fence applies per issuing handle, because a handle's revocation
state lives in the records bucket while credential indexes live here, and two buckets share
no order: each sturdy handle has an auth-bucket gate `srcgate.<issuerKeyId>.<id>`
(`{ state: open | frozen }`, CAS). Handle revocation CASes the source gate to `frozen`
**before** it enumerates `bysrc.`, and a redemption, after writing its `cred.`/`bysrc.`
rows, revision-pinned-CASes the source gate of EVERY handle in the presented chain (plus the
lifecycle gate below), releasing only if all are still `open` at their observed revisions. An
in-flight redemption under a handle being revoked therefore either finishes before the freeze
(its rows are in the enumeration) or loses a CAS and never releases. **Handle revocation
carries the SAME cluster-wide eviction as a lifecycle barrier** (§13.9 `evictPrincipal`):
after freezing the source gate and enumerating `bysrc.`, revocation revokes every descendant
credential AND verifies revocation enforced on every server, then evicts and re-scans the live
connections of every revoked credential's principal, fail-closed, an already-connected
descendant credential is never silently left with live grants. The handle status write is
acked only after that eviction is verified complete.

An unledgered mint MUST NOT occur (the ledger write precedes credential
release, fail-closed), and the rule carries a mechanical audit invariant in the style of the
§13.9 matrix grep test: every credential the auth authority has ever released MUST resolve
to a `cred.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` row; an issuance path that cannot show its ledger
row is non-conformant, auditable by diffing issued-credential ids against the ledger.

**Issuance gate (normative).** "Freeze issuance" is a durable transition, not an assertion:
each managed-agent lifecycle has a gate key `gate.<lifecycleUid>` in the same auth KV,
`{ state: open | frozen | retired, generation, op? }` (CAS). A `frozen` gate MUST carry a
durable **operation intent** `op = { opId, kind: activation | takeover | registration |
retirement, successor? }`: after a crash the intent alone
decides WHICH operation a frozen gate belongs to and what may advance it, a retry or
reconciler resumes the SAME `opId`, and a writer that is not that operation's executor
MUST NOT advance, reopen, or terminalize the gate.
**A crash can leave the gate frozen under an operation whose executor no longer exists**, and
fail-closed then blocks every restart while protecting nothing. An operator-facing reconciler
MAY complete that dead operation's obligation — resuming its SAME `opId` and reopening at the
UNCHANGED coordinate with `generation` advanced by one — but ONLY after it has AFFIRMATIVELY
verified that the gate's freeze-holder principal is gone, via the same liveness machinery the
barrier's eviction trusts (`principalLiveness`, §13.9). A holder that is alive, or whose
liveness cannot be proven, MUST refuse; a timeout or an incomplete sweep is unknowability and
MUST NOT be read as death. The affirmative check is a PRECONDITION ON TOP OF the barrier's own
verified eviction, never a replacement for it. A `retired` gate RETAINS the
terminalizing operation's intent as audit, and an idempotent terminal retry succeeds only
for that SAME operation. **Successor coordinates are per-kind and derivable, never loose
prose**: an `activation` or `retirement` intent carries NO `successor` (an activation's
successor IS the head mapping the same operation writes; a retirement has none); a
`takeover` or `registration` operation's successor artifacts are durably keyed by its own
`opId` (the `stage.<opId>.` staging family and the operation's audit rows), so
`{ opId, kind }` alone resumes deterministically. The gate MAY carry a `successor` summary
token for those two kinds, but the staged rows are authoritative and a resumer MUST NOT
act on a summary that the staged rows do not corroborate. **Allowed transitions are also
per-kind**: a gate is BORN `frozen` only under an `activation` intent (and only for a UID
whose `uid.` reservation already exists); `open → frozen` belongs to `takeover`,
`registration`, and `retirement`; `frozen → open` (reopen) belongs to `activation`,
`takeover`, and a `registration` abort, NEVER `retirement` (a retirement freeze never
reopens); `frozen → retired` belongs to `activation` (a head-CAS loser terminalizing its
own orphan gate) and `retirement`, NEVER `takeover` or `registration` (those abort by
reopening). An implementation MUST refuse a transition whose gate op kind is outside these
sets, before any CAS is attempted. The `opId` is an identifier, never a
bearer capability: a resumer re-authenticates as the operation's executor, and possession
of the id alone grants nothing. `retired` is terminal, a retired
lifecycle never mints again. `frozen` is **not** terminal, because a supervised restart
preserves the UID (§13.1) and must mint the successor process's root credential: the
takeover barrier freezes at generation `G`, completes revoke + verified eviction of the
family, and only then CASes the gate to `open` at generation `G+1`; the reopen is the
barrier's own final step, so no credential of generation `G` is ever live when generation
`G+1` mints. A gate reopen by anyone but the completing barrier is non-conformant.
**Endpoint instances use a disjoint gate family, distinguished by explicit prefix and
never by token arity**: the endpoint issuance gate is `epgate.<endpoint>.<instanceId>`,
`{ state: open | frozen | retired, generation, processEpoch, registrationRevision,
nameAuthorityRevision, principal, op? }` (the endpoint fence coordinates of §13.5/§13.7, plus
`principal`: the serving instance's own CONNZ-attributable connection principal, recorded at
registration), and
endpoint-derived credentials ledger under `epcred.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<credentialId>`
with the same row schema, mint protocol, gate discipline, and never-delete rules as
`cred.`/`gate.`. **`holderPrincipal` is ALWAYS a CONNZ-attributable `<owner>.<actor>` in
BOTH families** (the barrier KICKs it; an endpoint NAME is not attributable and never sits
there): in `cred.` it is the caller principal; in `epcred.` it is the serving instance's own
connection principal, copied from the endpoint gate's `principal`, while the endpoint NAME that
forms the `epcred.` KEY is a SEPARATE row field, so the key identity and the eviction target
stay disjoint (an `epcred` row that put the endpoint name in `holderPrincipal` could never be
KICKed). The `cred.`/`epcred.` families hold ONLY conformant ledger rows:
implementation staging, half-minted state, and tombstone fences live in a distinct
`stage.` family, never under a ledger prefix a barrier enumerates.

**Remote manager-service authority (user-auth only).** `manager-service` is one CLOSED,
server-authored authority view, not a profile name, arbitrary bearer profile, or client-supplied
permission set. It exists only for a signed-in human whose current actor-ledger row contains the
dedicated `supervise` scope. `spawn` and `admin` never imply `supervise`, and `supervise` never
implies either. Only the loopback/operator exchange MAY issue this view; the public exchange and
every managed-agent secret exchange MUST refuse it. The callout re-reads the ledger row at exchange
and connect, so a missing, narrowed, or revoked `supervise` scope denies the next view exchange and
new connection with the full re-grant requirement. A plain user bearer remains `agent`-scoped.

The view names exactly one ordinary derived owner, a fixed server-selected manager actor, that
actor's lifecycle UID, and one opaque locally selected `instanceId`. The actor and instance id are
not client-selectable, and the view grants no second manager instance, other endpoint, or other owner.
It may reach only the manager instance's own `svc.manager.<instanceId>` registration/status,
pre-authorized immutable contract publication, endpoint rails, and the disjoint
`epgate.manager.<instanceId>` / `epcred.manager.<instanceId>.<credentialId>` family. It does not
confer the space signer, callout signer, owner secret, static provisioner credential, generic
stream/KV authority, or authority over another instance's gate, records, contracts, or
credentials. A manager-service credential is ledgered and gated exactly as this section requires;
its `holderPrincipal` is the derived-owner/fixed-actor principal, never the endpoint name.

The host, not the participant, issues every data-account credential requiring the account signing
key. The only remote path is the lifecycle- and instance-bound typed protocol of §13.6; a broader
bearer or a generic credential-mint endpoint is non-conformant. Its gate is frozen before staged
material becomes usable; every release is preceded by the ledger write and gate CAS; and all
replay/idempotency coordinates bind the owner, fixed actor, lifecycle UID, instanceId, operation,
and public nkey. A remote manager may provision a managed descendant only after the host validates
that its current owner equals the manager-service owner and the current manager grant; that is a
same-owner validation seam, not delegated signer authority. Revocation freezes the one family,
rejects fresh material and new connections, and proceeds through the bounded renewal/verified
revocation policy below. It MUST NOT silently substitute static or local authority.

**A read is never a fence; only a CAS write is.** JetStream `DIRECT.GET` may be served by a
follower or mirror and gives NO read-your-writes guarantee (a mint that *reads* the gate can
observe a stale `open` after a barrier froze it on the leader), so the auth bucket sets
`allow_direct=false` (§13.12) and every fence here is a leader-served, revision-pinned CAS
write. The mint protocol is **observe gate → write rows → CAS the gate → release**: the auth
path reads the gate (recording `state`, `generation`, and KV `revision`), writes the
`cred.`/`bysrc.` rows, then performs a **revision-pinned CAS update of `gate.<lifecycleUid>`
itself at the observed revision**; a leader write that fails if the gate changed at all,
and releases the credential only on CAS success with the gate still `open` at the same
generation. On CAS failure, `frozen`/`retired`, or any generation advance it aborts and marks
its own row revoked, never releasing. A barrier CASes the gate to `frozen` FIRST and only then
enumerates the family. The race is closed by **serialization on one key**, not by timing or
read freshness: freeze and mint-finalize are both CAS writes to the SAME gate key, so one
loses; a mint that wins wrote its rows before its winning CAS, so the barrier's later
enumeration sees them; a mint that loses never released. The ledger is written only by the
trusted auth path (§13.9 matrix; NATS binding: the auth KV, §13.12).

**Every lifecycle operation is a cross-bucket saga, never an implied transaction.** The
records head and the auth gate/ledger live in different buckets with no shared order, so
each operation persists its durable intent (the gate `op`, above) before touching the
second bucket, every crash boundary resumes the SAME operation from that intent, and the
safe orders are normative. **Initial activation, in order**: reserve the UID (create-only
`uid.<lifecycleUid>`, above) → create the issuance gate `frozen` carrying the activation
`op` (unmintable from birth; no credential is ever released under a frozen gate, per the
unledgered-mint rule) → CAS the alias head to the new mapping (`active`) → reopen the gate
at its first mintable generation as the operation's LAST step. A head-CAS loser
terminalizes its own orphan gate and burns its reserved UID (never deleting either); a
crash after the head CAS leaves the lifecycle active-but-unreachable, and recovery resumes
the same activation `opId`, never minting a second UID for one activation. **Takeover**
keeps the barrier order above (freeze → revoke + verified-evict → epoch head CAS LAST →
reopen). **Terminal retirement** keeps the barrier order below. No other head transition
exists: the head advances only inside these operations, and no epoch-advance or retire
seam is exposed outside the operation that completes its barrier.

Binding rule (normative): **durable** authority and state; sturdy handles, accepted goals,
checkpoint tokens and resumes, durable consumers and delivery state, ledger rows, bind
`(principal, lifecycleUid)` and survive supervised restart. **Live** authority, session
grants, reply attribution, serve/commit ownership, additionally binds the process epoch and
dies on restart. The alias alone authorizes nothing: a delayed or redelivered request, handle,
or teardown that names a recycled alias fails against the replacement because the lifecycle
UID differs. Endpoint daemons carry the same triple, with the **stable logical instance id**
(`instanceId`, `[a-z0-9]{26,32}`, ≥128 bits of CSPRNG entropy, persisted for the endpoint
lifetime) as their routable identity component. `instanceId` is **minted by the provisioner,
never reused, and unique within `(space, endpoint)`**, the allocator records it in the
instance's service record by create-only CAS and rejects collisions durably. Reply
attribution, scatter deduplication, queue ownership, and the event/timer planes all key on
it, so its uniqueness and entropy are load-bearing, not cosmetic. `instanceId` is to an
endpoint what `lifecycleUid` is to a managed agent, and both follow the same
restart-preserve / terminal-retire / epoch-fence rules.

**Cross-plane scoping.** Chat/DM/presence *subjects* keep the §3 grammar (the alias), but
their backing state is lifecycle-scoped: presence carries the current `lifecycleUid` (§6);
per-instance durable consumers, pending delivery cursors, durable memberships, history
cutoffs, and ACL/ledger rows key on `(principal, lifecycleUid)` (§8, §9). The DM subjects
(`inst.>`) DELIBERATELY stay alias-keyed; a second implementer MUST NOT uid-scope them; the
successor cut for DMs is the ACTIVATION FRONTIER (the DM stream sequence captured at the
lifecycle's provisioning, delivery starting at frontier+1, §8), and that frontier capture is
a leader-served read (the §13.9 read-service class), never a follower get. Explicit same-name
recreation inherits **no** predecessor authority or content: terminal retirement records
per-stream sequence cutoffs before the alias is freed, messages published while no lifecycle
is active do not flow to a later replacement, and retirement across streams is ordered and
reconciled (never assumed atomic). **Destructive cleanup is broker-enforced where the resource is broker-addressable**: durable
consumer names, ACL rows, KV record keys, and membership rows are lifecycle-keyed, the UID
is part of the resource NAME, and the teardown credential (the deprovisioner) is minted
target-pinned to `(principal, lifecycleUid)` by exact name, so a credential minted for
lifecycle A cannot even NAME lifecycle B's resources; the broker denies the stale delete
outright. Only resources the broker cannot see (the manager's local credential/token/health
files) fall back to a handler-side **delete-if-current** check carrying the retiring UID +
expected ownership revision. In both regimes the alias stays reserved until retirement and
cleanup have durably completed, so a stale detached teardown can never destroy a same-name
successor. **Terminal retirement is additionally a credential barrier, in order**: CAS the issuance
gate `open → frozen` carrying the durable retirement `op` FIRST (the bar: a staged mint
loses the gate CAS, exactly the mint-protocol race above; the gate revision moves, so a
mint that observed `open` cannot finalize) → CAS the head `active → retiring` bound to the
same `op.opId` (from this point every currency seam yields no current mapping and no
current epoch, and the alias is NOT replaceable) → revoke every
active credential-ledger row under the lifecycle prefix (all roots and all descendants,
credential ledger above), verifying revocation enforcement on every server as in the
takeover barrier → cluster-verified eviction of every revoked credential's live connections
(`evictPrincipal`, as in the takeover barrier above) → **drain the target's acceptance
obligations to quiescence** (§13.8: enumerate `oblig.<targetUid>.>`, settle every
unresolved row through its decision coordinate, and re-enumerate until an enumeration
finds none unsettled; every writer that observed the pre-`retiring` mapping is settled
HERE, before the cleaner below runs and before any frontier closes) → **fence the drain's
per-op repair principals** (the commit applier, pool-route reconciler, and effects canceller
minted inside the drain, `local.{epapl|eprec|epcan}_<opId-hash>`): cluster-verify eviction of
any live connection under each BEFORE the cleaner and BEFORE any frontier — the applier
especially, whose records-KV last-value write is returned to a normal reader regardless of the
per-stream frontier cutoff. These are self-minted data-account bearers with NO credential-ledger
row, so there is no connect-time deny-new: the guarantee here is **kill-live** (verified eviction
of currently-connected principals), NOT reconnect prevention; a fresh connect within the
bearer's TTL is the accepted residual NAMED per drain-repair profile in the §13.9 matrix (each
"RETIREMENT-FENCE residual" row), of the same kill-live-not-deny-new class §13.13 fences for the
plane connections (repair connections MUST be minted non-reconnecting so a verified eviction is
durable) → the trusted terminal **pool
cleaner** settles the lifecycle's expired and orphaned pool work under a DISTINCT,
separately minted, exact-pool scoped profile whose pool set is this operation's **effective
inventory**: the target's accepted `oblig.<lifecycleUid>.>` pool routes enumerated from the
SAME drained, now-`retiring` obligation set (so no new row can appear and the enumeration is
deterministic across resumes). The inventory is DISCOVERY-ONLY: the barrier takes no
caller-supplied pool hint, so every inventory entry is an obligation-discovered pool this target
holds accepted work on, and no pool ever enters the cleaner/executor grant without a backing
obligation. Confinement is the EXACT per-pool effective-inventory grant plus the
executor's per-item decision/horizon/retire-target checks (which bind HONEST execution, not a
compromised bearer): (§13.9
matrix row: bind-only on the pool's
pre-created durable, terminal-only ACK after the item's durable terminal fact, no consumer
create/update/delete, no raw stream DELETE; it never holds, reuses, or impersonates the
revoked owner's authority, which this barrier just killed) → **retire the cleaner
credential itself, verified, BEFORE any frontier closes**: once the cleaner has settled the
pool and proven it quiescent (every pre-existing owner ACK drained through `AckWait`, and a
fresh consumer read shows zero `num_pending` and zero `ack_pending`; a fire-and-forget ACK
is confirmed with `AckSync` or re-proven, never assumed), the barrier REVOKES the cleaner's
own bounded-lived credential and cluster-verifies eviction of its principal (`evictPrincipal`,
exactly as for the owner above), so no in-flight cleaner can ACK a redelivery or write a
terminal after the alias is reused; the cleaner's authority MUST be dead before the frontier
records → record the
per-stream retirement frontiers (the create-only, never-deleted `frontier.<lifecycleUid>`
record, §13.7: one key per retired lifecycle, recorded once under this operation's `opId`) →
CAS the gate `frozen → retired` (terminal; unlike
takeover, retirement never reopens it) → CAS the head `retiring → retired` → only then
free the alias, and a successor activates only with a freshly reserved UID. `retired` on
the head therefore ASSERTS completed cleanup: replacing a retired predecessor needs no
further proof, because nothing reaches `retired` without the barrier. Every boundary of
this sequence is crash-resumable through the durable `op` intent, and only the same
operation resumes it. Chat/DM/presence subjects stay
alias-keyed, so without the revoke-and-verified-evict step a still-connected stale process
could keep speaking as the recycled alias. Where the deployment cannot revoke the credential
or cannot verify eviction, alias reuse is **forbidden**: a same-name respawn fails loud.
Supervised restart of the same UID retains all of it.
Intentional role-mailbox continuity across lifecycles is only available as an explicit,
separately authorized transfer operation, never an accidental consequence of string reuse.

### 13.2 Grammar

**Endpoint names.** An endpoint name is one or more DNS-shaped labels, each matching
`[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?` (no leading/trailing dash, no bare dashes; `_` MUST NOT
appear in a label). Single-label names (`manager`, `delivery`) are reserved for
endpoints shipped by this contract's reference implementation and require the space operator's
provisioning authority to serve; a third-party endpoint name MUST be reverse-DNS (two or more
labels under a domain its author controls, e.g. `com.acme.deploy`) and is mintable only under
the owner that registered that domain claim. In a wire subject the name is one token with `.`
replaced by `_` (`com_acme_deploy`); because `_` cannot appear in a label the mapping is
bijective. Name authority is the credential, never the registry (§13.9). Endpoint-name
tokens may contain `-` inside labels; they are never used to derive principal dash-form
names; control-surface consumer names are the §13.9 pinned grammars, each carrying a
stated collision-freedom argument, and none is ever parsed back into its components, so
the §2 dash-form separator stays unambiguous.

**Command tokens.** A command name is one token `[a-z0-9-]{1,32}`. The command is a validated
subject token so the broker enforces per-command authority (§13.9). `describe` and `cancel`
are reserved command names (§13.7, §13.6).

**Request subjects.** Three **addressing modes** under one kind `ep`, the mode token says
where a request routes, never which verb it is (the verb rides the envelope, §13.3/§13.5):
`one` (queue-group anycast: exactly one class member), `all` (scatter: every instance),
`inst` (one instance by its stable triple). The `one` rail's queue group is canonically
named by the endpoint-name token, and serve subscriptions to it are **queue-qualified
only** (§13.9): no credential can plain-subscribe the class rail, which is what keeps
per-request nonces visible only to the queue-selected instance. Every request carries the caller as **three**
forge-locked tokens `<owner>.<actor>.<uid>` (principal + lifecycle UID, §13.1) followed by a
caller-chosen unguessable **nonce** token (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]{22,64}`, ≥128 bits of CSPRNG
entropy; one outstanding call per nonce; reuse before the prior call resolves is a caller
error and the reply rail MUST treat the earlier subscription as dead); always, on calls and
casts alike, so one grant row covers both verbs and no shape is distinguished by counting. A
command whose contract declares it **targeted** carries an **authorization-mode token** and,
per mode, zero to three pinned target tokens between the command and the caller:

| Form | Subject | Tokens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Class, untargeted | `cotal.<space>.ep.one.<endpoint>.<command>.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.<nonce>` | 10 |
| Class, `self` | `cotal.<space>.ep.one.<endpoint>.<command>.self.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.<nonce>` | 11 |
| Class, `owner`/`any` | `cotal.<space>.ep.one.<endpoint>.<command>.<authz>.<tOwner>.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.<nonce>` | 12 |
| Class, `child`/`ledger` | `cotal.<space>.ep.one.<endpoint>.<command>.<authz>.<tOwner>.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.<nonce>` | 12 |
| Class, `handle` | `cotal.<space>.ep.one.<endpoint>.<command>.handle.<tOwner>.<tActor>.<tUid>.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.<nonce>` | 14 |
| Scatter | as class forms with mode token `all` | 10-14 |
| Instance | `cotal.<space>.ep.inst.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<command>[.<authz>[.<target tokens per mode>]].<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.<nonce>` | 11-15 |
| Reply | `cotal.<space>.ep.reply.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.<nonce>` | 11 |

**Single-owner endpoint names (normative).** An endpoint name binds to exactly ONE owner
(§13.9: operator-provisioned core names, domain-owner-bound reverse-DNS names), so the name
token alone determines the serving owner and instance-addressed subjects carry **no owner
tokens**: `(endpoint, instanceId)` is the complete routable instance address. Two parties
wanting the "same" name use their own reverse-DNS names; an owner-qualified shared-name form,
if ever wanted, would be a later additive subject form, not a change to these. This trades an
already-forbidden expressiveness for structurally smaller subjects and credentials.

**Remote manager service.** The core `manager` name remains operator-governed: a
`manager-service` bearer (§13.1) does not transfer its name authority or create a generic
user-owned endpoint. It is the one closed user-auth exception to the single-owner endpoint rule:
the host may authorize one `manager` service instance whose service-record owner and serving
principal are the bearer's derived owner plus fixed server-selected manager actor. The exception is
scoped by the server-authorized lifecycle UID and opaque globally unique instance id, so the
`(manager, instanceId)` route stays unambiguous and no registration can be mistaken for another
owner's. The standard `ep` grammar is unchanged: the bearer reaches only that exact manager
instance, while the manager's own agent-control requests use the existing owner and same-owner
descendant checks. No endpoint name, target form, or wildcard is added for this view.

The target's **lifecycle UID is body-carried, not a subject token** (`target.lifecycleUid`,
§13.3): a grant could only ever wildcard it (targets are dynamic; the UID is unknowable at
mint time), so a token there would add zero broker enforcement while costing every targeted
grant row a token, the trusted validator, not the broker, compares the expected UID against
the current mapping (§13.1). The one exception is `handle` mode: at handle redemption the
target's UID IS known and current, so the redemption-minted form pins the full target triple
as subject tokens (below); pin what is knowable at mint time; body-carry only what is not.
Every form stays within the NATS 16-token recommendation.

**Explicit discrimination (never arity counting).** The forms are distinguished by the token
after `<command>`: it is either one of the six reserved authorization-mode tokens (`self`,
`owner`, `any`, `child`, `ledger`, `handle`) or the caller's owner token, and the two sets
are disjoint by construction, because an owner token is `local` or `u_`+base32 (§2), never a
bare mode word. The target-block arity then follows the mode (`self`: none;
`owner`/`any`/`child`/`ledger`: one `<tOwner>` token; `handle`: three,
`<tOwner>.<tActor>.<tUid>`); a closed set at a fixed position, exactly the property that
makes per-mode arity safe. A parser dispatches on that set; a subject matching no defined shape
has no sender and MUST NOT be handled.

**Token bounds (normative).** On the endpoint rails every identity token is bounded:
`owner` ≤ 64, `actor` ≤ 64, `command` ≤ 32, `endpoint` ≤ 64, nonce and ids ≤ 64 characters;
`lifecycleUid` and `instanceId` are bounded by their single defining grammar
`[a-z0-9]{26,32}` (§13.1); deliberately not restated here, so the bound cannot drift from
the definition. A total request or reply subject MUST NOT
exceed 1024 bytes; implementations validate fail-loud at build time. (Transport headroom:
the reference deployment raises `max_control_line` to 64 KiB; the PUB line is never the
binding constraint; minted-credential size is, §13.9.)

**The authorization-mode token** (`<authz>`) makes the authority gradient explicit and
broker-enforced where it is statically expressible, and honestly validator-primary where it is
not. Six modes:

- `self`, the target IS the caller: the form carries **no target tokens and no body
  `target`** (a supplied one is `target-mismatch`, never ignored); the endpoint derives the
  target from the broker-authenticated caller triple in the same subject. Fully
  broker-confined, including the lifecycle UID, because the caller's own `<uid>` token is
  the target's UID, forge-locked by the mint: a stale lifecycle's credential cannot even
  publish the successor's subject.
- `owner`, owner-domain: the target block is `<authz>.<tOwner>` (ONE target token); grants
  pin `<tOwner>` to the caller's own owner (standing mints; a handle redemption instead pins
  the issuer-signed target owner, §13.6). The target actor and expected lifecycle UID are
  body-carried (`target`) and validator-checked against the current mapping, the broker
  cannot express "any actor under my owner, currently mapped to this UID". An `owner`-mode
  grant is NEVER minted with a wildcard target owner. Broker-confined on the owner; validator
  on the rest.
- `any`, unrestricted target owner (`<authz>.<tOwner>` with `*`): a distinct mode mintable
  only for operator/admin capabilities, so no widening of an `owner` grant can ever reach
  it. Validator-checked target as for `owner`.
- `handle`, **redemption-minted only** (§13.6): the target block is
  `handle.<tOwner>.<tActor>.<tUid>` (THREE target tokens), each a literal pinned at
  redemption from the issuer-signed grant against the then-current mapping. Never a standing
  capability, never wildcarded. Broker-confined on the full target triple; the validator
  re-checks only currency; a subject `<tUid>` that no longer matches the current mapping is
  `expired`.
- `child`, static-mesh own-child (`spawner == caller`): a **distinct trusted-validator form**.
  The grant means "may ask this validator", not "already authorized"; the handler MUST
  fresh-check the immutable spawner relation against durable state and fail closed. Its
  `<tOwner>` ceiling is the caller's own owner, as for `owner` mode (a static-mesh child
  shares its spawner's owner).
- `ledger`, fresh-ledger escalation: a distinct trusted-validator form; the handler MUST
  fresh-read the authorization ledger and fail closed on lookup failure, timeout, or absence.
  Its grants pin literal `<tOwner>` values named at mint; a wildcard target owner in `ledger`
  mode is mintable only for operator/admin profiles.

`any`, `child`, `ledger`, and `handle` are never wildcard-reachable from a `self`/`owner`
grant (distinct token ⇒ distinct subject ⇒ distinct grant row). A handler MUST resolve the target (the
revision-pinned `(alias, lifecycleUid)` mapping, §13.1) immediately before effect and reject
any request whose body target disagrees with the subject target tokens (`target-mismatch`) or
whose expected target lifecycle UID does not match the current mapping (`expired`). The
subject, never the body, is the authorization boundary; handler policy only narrows.

**Replies.** Every reply rides the dedicated reply rail above, **deterministically derived
from the authenticated request subject**: the responder copies the caller triple and nonce
from the request subject and prefixes its own endpoint/instance/epoch tokens (the owner is
determined by the endpoint name; no owner tokens appear). A responder
MUST ignore any transport- or payload-supplied reply target (the confused-deputy boundary).
The grants are exact-arity, no `>` tail admits subjects outside the grammar: the caller's
read grant is its own rail (`ep.reply.*.*.*.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.*`), so it reads only
replies addressed to it; the responder's publish grant pins its own instance triple and
epoch (`ep.reply.<endpoint>.<iId>.<epoch>.*.*.*.*`), so the answering instance and
epoch are read off the broker-authenticated reply subject, never trusted from the payload.
Two properties, enforced differently, stated precisely: **attribution** (who answered) is
broker-enforced by the responder's pinned prefix; **addressing** (whom a responder may
answer) is capability-by-secret, the responder's grant spans all caller suffixes, and what
confines it to the requester is possession of the unguessable per-request nonce, which only
the request's recipients hold. A stale process (superseded epoch) publishes attributably
stale replies that callers reject; scatter gathers additionally reject replies from
instances outside the frozen expected set (§13.5).

**Incarnation admission (the bound-incarnation fence).** Rejecting a reply is a REPORT, not a
guard: it happens after the responder has already handled the request. On the class rail the
queue picks the responder, so a caller that resolved incarnation B can have its command executed
by A and then be told the call failed — with no way to say whether any effect landed. A caller
that will accept an effect only from the incarnation it resolved therefore declares it in the
request (`bind`, §13.3), and a responder that is not that incarnation **MUST refuse it at the
pre-effect seam** — before args validation, before target resolution, and before the §13.6/§13.10
governed gate, which may consume a one-use payment proof. The refusal carries
`ai.cotal.ep.bind-refused` and means the command did not run, so re-resolving and re-issuing
cannot duplicate an effect; that is the distinction `ai.cotal.ep.unbound-responder` (raised by the
caller, on the reply) cannot make. `bind` is a caller declaration and never authority: it can only
narrow a request the subject already routed, and attribution still comes from the reply subject —
a refusal attributed to the very incarnation the caller bound is incoherent and MUST be rejected
(`internal`) rather than honored. A responder that does not implement the fence ignores the field
(§5) and executes; the caller-side check remains the only protection in that skewed pair.

The **caller's** process epoch is
deliberately NOT encoded in the rails: reply consumption binds to the requesting process
because a caller MUST subscribe the exact concrete nonce subject before publishing a call
and MUST NOT persist nonces; a restarted successor never holds the predecessor's nonce
subscriptions, so in-flight calls die with the process (they are ephemeral by definition)
and a late reply is unreadable rather than misdelivered.

**Event and journal subjects.** Endpoint-published planes, captured by per-space streams
(§13.12); the publishing instance's identity is forge-locked into the subject:

| Plane | Subject |
| --- | --- |
| Events | `cotal.<space>.epe.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.<topic...>` |
| Canonical facts | `cotal.<space>.epf.<endpoint>.<topic...>` |
| Submissions | `cotal.<space>.epj.<endpoint>.<command>[.<authz>[.<target tokens per mode>]].<owner>.<actor>.<uid>` |
| Timers | `cotal.<space>.ept.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.<timerId>.<schedule\|armed\|fire>` |
| Record writes | `cotal.<space>.epr.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.<kind>.<qualifier...>` (mediated record-writer ingress; the instance's epoch-pinned rail for `svc`/`goal`/`cp` status writes; consumed ONLY by the record writer, which reads the writing epoch from the broker-authenticated subject, never from payload, §13.9) |
| Contract artifacts | `cotal.<space>.epc.<digest-hex>` (one immutable artifact per subject; `<digest-hex>` is the artifact's SHA-256 hex, 64 chars; the `sha256:` prefix is not a subject token; §13.7) |
| Work pools | `cotal.<space>.epw.<endpoint>.<pool>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>` (one item per subject; the trailing four tokens are the item's **acceptance identity**; the accepted submission's caller triple + request id, §13.6) |
| Sessions | `cotal.<space>.eps.<endpoint>.<sessionId>.<epoch>.<in\|out>` |

Events carry the publishing instance's **epoch as a subject token**, pinned by the serve
grant, so a superseded process cannot emit progress indistinguishable from the current
incarnation's; readers match the current (or goal-accepted) epoch and treat stale-epoch
events as attributably stale. A **targeted** journal command carries the same authz/target
block in its submission subject as its request forms, so the broker confines targeted
journal work exactly as it confines calls; the canonicalizer additionally requires exact
body/subject agreement before acceptance. Timers use three forms: `.schedule` is the
instance-published **schedule request**, captured by a stream with message schedules
DISABLED, so any client-set scheduling header is inert bytes, and the mediated timer writer
rejects a request carrying one; `.armed` holds the **authoritative schedule message**,
published only by the mediated timer writer (§13.9), which derives the ADR-51
`Nats-Schedule-Target`, the sibling `.fire` subject, from the broker-authenticated
REQUEST subject's own tokens, never from any payload or header (a schedule's target MUST
differ from its publish subject per ADR-51; replacement is the writer's same-subject
publish on `.armed`); `.fire` is where fires appear. An instance's serve grant covers
**only `.schedule`** (epoch-pinned); no client credential holds `.armed` or `.fire`
publish; fired messages are written by the broker's scheduler alone, and the handler
validates the carried `(timerId, generation)` against current status AND
`now ≥ the authoritative deadline` AND that the broker-authored scheduler-origin header
names its own exact sibling `.armed` subject (§13.12) before acting.

Reserved event topics: `ev.<cluster>.<event>` (cluster events), `goal.<cOwner>.<cActor>.
<cUid>.<goalId>.<t>` (per-goal action progress; the caller identity in the subject gives
mint-time read containment), `cp.<token>.<t>` (checkpoint transitions). Reserved fact topics:
`dec.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>` (canonical decisions (accepted/rejected) caller-scoped, §13.4), `quar.<sourceSeq>` (poison quarantine, §13.4; its own family,
disjoint from the caller-id `dec` namespace by construction), `goal.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<goalId>.result` (terminal
results), `wrk.<pool>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>` (per-work-item terminal results,
keyed by the item's acceptance identity, §13.5/§13.6), `eff.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>`
(per-request effect-complete facts for non-action effects commands, §13.9), `cp.<token>` (one-use checkpoint
resume, journaled by create-only CAS, §13.6),
`receipt.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>.<sourceSeq>`
(caller-scoped; request ids are caller-chosen, so an endpoint-wide `receipt.<id>` would
let two callers collide and read each other's receipts, and **execution-scoped**: the
accepted submission's `sourceSeq` is unique per execution, so a request id lawfully reused
after its decision retention expires (§13.4) mints a NEW receipt subject instead of
appending to the old one, where a last-by-subject read would have hidden the earlier
receipt for the rest of its 90-day retention). Submissions are publishable directly by capability holders
and are **explicitly untrusted** (§13.4); canonical fact subjects are publishable only by
their mediated writer (§13.9). `<id>`, `<goalId>`, `<timerId>`, `<token>`, `<sessionId>` are
single tokens `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`.

The v0 subjects `cotal.<space>.ctl.>` and `cotal.<space>.control.>` are retired: nothing
serves them and no post-cut credential carries a grant on them. `trace.<instance>` remains reserved,
unchanged. `<pool>` is a single token `[a-z0-9-]{1,32}` (command-token grammar).

### 13.3 Envelope

Requests, replies, submissions, events, facts, and progress payloads are UTF-8 JSON. The
envelope is versioned and typed; `ControlRequest`/`ControlReply` are deleted.

`EndpointRequest`:

| Field | Type | Req | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v` | `1` | MUST | envelope schema version (independent of the wire `protocolVersion`; the envelope starts at its own v1 inside the v0.4 revision); other values rejected (`unsupported-version`) |
| `id` | string | MUST | caller-chosen request id, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`; the idempotency key at the declared scope (§13.8), realized on journaled planes by the caller-scoped decision CAS (§13.4), never by a transport header |
| `op` | object | MUST | `{ endpoint, command, inputDigest, outputDigest }`; MUST agree with the subject (`op-mismatch`). The digests bind the invocation to the described contract and are **both REQUIRED on every command except `describe`** (the discovery bootstrap), unconditional, because every command declares both schemas: a side with no payload declares the canonical void schema (§13.7), whose digest exists like any other. A serving member rejects a missing digest (`contract-mismatch`) before any effect, and one that cannot honor a pinned digest replies `contract-mismatch`, never coerces |
| `class` | `ephemeral` \| `journal` | MUST | the submission's declared delivery contract; MUST equal the command's contract class (`class-mismatch`); immutable per submission. (`record` is a state contract, never a request class; the action composite is a command marker, not a class; an action command's submissions are `journal`) |
| `replyExpected` | boolean | MUST | the verb: `true` = call (a reply is expected on the reply rail; `deadlineMs` required; the caller subscribes its exact nonce before publishing), `false` = cast (fire-and-forget; a responder MUST NOT reply). The subject shape is identical for both; the verb never changes the grammar |
| `goalId` | string | action commands | MUST for a command whose contract declares the action composite: the client-generated goal id (§13.6); absent otherwise. `id` remains the per-request idempotency key |
| `target` | object | per mode | `{ owner, actor, lifecycleUid, mappingRevision? }`. **Absent for `self`** (and for untargeted ops): a supplied one is `target-mismatch`, never ignored. **Required for `owner`/`any`/`child`/`ledger`/`handle`**: `owner` MUST equal the subject `<tOwner>` token (`target-mismatch`); `actor` and `lifecycleUid` are validator-compared against the current mapping (`expired` on mismatch), and in `handle` mode MUST additionally equal the subject `<tActor>`/`<tUid>` tokens (`target-mismatch`); `mappingRevision`, when present, additionally pins the exact mapping revision the caller observed |
| `bind` | object | MAY | `{ instanceId, epoch }` — the incarnation the caller's `describe` resolved against. A responder whose own `(instanceId, epoch)` differs **MUST refuse before any effect**, at the pre-effect seam and ahead of the governed gate: `failed-precondition` when a different instance received it, `expired` when the same instance is at another epoch, both carrying `details[].kind = ai.cotal.ep.bind-refused`, which asserts the command **did not run**. **Absent on `describe`** (the bootstrap that produces the bind; a supplied one is `bad-request`) and **absent on the scatter rail** (which addresses every incarnation; `bad-request`). On the `inst` rail it MUST name the subject's instance (`bad-request` otherwise) and adds the epoch the subject grammar has no token for. It confers nothing and can only make a responder the subject already reached refuse, so it satisfies monotonic attenuation |
| `args` | object | MAY | validated against the input schema before any effect (`bad-request`) |
| `from` | `EndpointRef` | MUST | as §5; `from.id` MUST equal the subject sender principal, and the sender UID token MUST match the caller's minted lifecycle UID (broker-enforced by the grant) |
| `deadlineMs` | number | MUST for call/scatter and journal submissions | caller deadline budget; bounded, never unbounded. On a journal-class submission it is the **decision deadline**: the bound within which the caller expects its durable decision fact (§13.4) |
| `correlation` | object | MAY | `{ traceparent?, tracestate?, baggage? }` per W3C Trace Context; propagated to downstream calls, events, facts, receipts |
| `auth` | string | MAY | opaque signed authorization-context slot (capability handle, obligations, payment proof). Opaque to the transport, never to identity: its **`authDigest`** (§13.4 fingerprint) is `sha256:<hex>` over the UTF-8 bytes of this string **exactly as carried**; the slot is already a canonical signed artifact, so it is digested as bytes, never re-canonicalized, and is absent from the fingerprint iff `auth` is absent |

`EndpointReply`:

| Field | Type | Req | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v` | `1` | MUST | |
| `id` | string | MUST | echoes the request `id` |
| `ok` | boolean | MUST | |
| `data` | any JSON | MAY | present iff `ok`; validated against the output schema |
| `error` | object | iff `!ok` | `{ code, message, details?[], outcome? }`; codes below; `details[]` entries carry reverse-DNS `kind`; `outcome` per **Effect outcome** below |
| `receipt` | string | MAY | opaque signed receipt slot (§13.10) |

**Effect outcome.** An error reply MAY carry `error.outcome`, one of `executed`, `not-executed`,
or `unknown`, stating whether the command's effect occurred. It is emitted by the **responder**,
which is the only party that knows: a responder that refuses BEFORE dispatching to the handler
MUST carry `not-executed`, and one that refuses AFTER the handler has run MUST carry `executed`.
A responder that cannot distinguish the two MUST carry `unknown` rather than guess. An error
reply that omits `outcome` MUST be read as `unknown`.

`outcome` describes a reply, and only a reply. A refusal a CALLER raises locally is not an
`EndpointReply` and carries no `outcome` field. It does not follow that the caller knows nothing:
it MUST classify the refusal from what it observed, and only one of the four cases below is
genuinely `unknown`.

- **Refused before publication** — the request was never put on the wire. The caller knows the
  effect did not occur and MUST classify it `not-executed`. Treating this as `unknown` suppresses
  a retry that is provably safe, including for a `write`.
- **Refused while holding a reply** — the caller parsed a reply and then rejected it for a reason
  of its own, the §13.2 post-reply currency check being the case in this document. What the caller
  knows comes from the reply it holds: an `ok:true` reply means the handler ran to completion, so
  the refusal is `executed`; an `ok:false` reply carries the responder's own `outcome`, which the
  caller MUST adopt rather than overwrite. Discarding a held reply's outcome because the caller
  went on to reject the reply loses the one fact the responder was in a position to state.
- **Answered by the broker with no responders** — the request subject had zero subscribers, and
  the broker says so on the reserved no-responders sentinel. That is a positive, broker-attested
  fact that nothing received the request, so it is `not-executed`, not merely unanswered. A caller
  MUST trust it ONLY on that reserved sentinel, which carries no responder publish grant: the same
  status on an ordinary reply subject is a responder's own claim and proves nothing about
  delivery.
- **No reply observed** — a deadline that expires with no answer at all, a transport failure after
  publication, any path where the caller cannot tell whether the request was handled. This is
  `unknown`, and it is the only local case that is.

A caller **MUST NOT infer execution from the mere arrival of a reply**: a reply proves the request
was HANDLED, never that it executed. The two differ on every path where a responder refuses before
the handler — the version, class, target, sender, authz, contract, and guard checks all publish
`ok:false` having executed nothing, and each of those replies says so in its own `outcome`.

`outcome` exists because a refusal code alone cannot carry this fact: the same code and the same
message are correct for a request that ran and for one that never left, and a caller that cannot
tell them apart and retries duplicates the effect. `effect` (§13.7) tells a client whether a
repeat is safe; `outcome` tells the caller what already happened. Neither substitutes for the
other, and a `write` command refused with `unknown` is precisely the case where no automatic
recovery is available and the decision belongs to the caller.

`outcome` is NOT a goal's terminal state. An action accepted under §13.6 reports its result as a
goal fact; an accepted action whose caller then loses its follow has an `outcome` of `executed`
for the SUBMISSION and no terminal state at all, which are different facts about different
things. `outcome` MUST NOT be used to report, replace, or summarize a goal outcome.

The answering instance, its epoch, and the addressee are read from the **reply subject**
(§13.2), not from payload fields; a payload claim of either is advisory display data only.

Every other plane is typed too: a journaled **submission** is an `EndpointRequest` (same
envelope, published to `epj`); an **event** (incl. per-goal progress) is
`{ v: 1, topic, ts, data, correlation? }`; an **acceptance fact** is the `AcceptanceFact` of
§13.4; a **terminal result fact** carries the goal's terminal state (one of the five
terminal values of §13.6), outcome digest, and
result payload (or its digest-pinned reference). All are runtime-validated at their
consuming boundary.

**Monotonic attenuation (invariant).** Envelope content, the `auth` slot, a handle,
obligations; may only narrow what the presenting credential already permits, never widen it.
A handler that honors envelope content as authority beyond the broker grant is non-conformant.
Authority *conferral* exists only as trusted redemption (§13.6 capability handle).

**Error catalog.** `code` is one token: `bad-request`, `unsupported-version`, `op-mismatch`,
`class-mismatch`, `target-mismatch`, `sender-mismatch`, `unauthenticated`,
`permission-denied`, `not-found`, `already-exists`, `conflict` (CAS/fencing loss,
fingerprint conflict, duplicate resume), `contract-mismatch`, `contract-invalid` (schema
outside the profile / over budget at registration), `failed-precondition`,
`deadline-exceeded`, `cancelled`, `expired` (lease, handle, lifecycle UID, epoch, token),
`unavailable` (no responder), `unimplemented`, `resource-exhausted`, `internal`. Extensions
add codes only under reverse-DNS. A `code` (catalog or extension) is one token of at
most **64 bytes**, so every fact shape that embeds one (`RejectionFact`, `QuarantineFact`)
stays bounded by construction and the §13.12 fact fixture is a true worst case.

### 13.4 Delivery contracts

Three delivery contracts, chosen per command class, declared in the contract, immutable per
submission. Decision rule: crash means "just re-ask" → **ephemeral**; long-lived state
something converges on → **record**; must survive restart, be audited, metered, or
compensated → **journal**. Wrong-class submission fails loud.

**Ephemeral**, request/reply on the `ep` rails; no broker persistence; at-most-once effect
unless the command is idempotent by `id`. No-responder is a loud `unavailable`.

**Record**, a `{kind, schema, spec, status, meta}` resource in the per-space records bucket,
stored as **two keys with independent revisions**: `<key>.spec` and `<key>.status`. The split
is the broker-enforced writer boundary: the spec-writer and status-writer roles hold publish
grants on their own key only (per-kind writer table, §13.9). Writes use per-key CAS; a lost
race is a loud `conflict`. The merged logical read returns both
revisions and carries `status.observedSpecRevision`; a reader treats
`observedSpecRevision < spec.revision` as a stale-but-valid level-triggered projection, not
an error, and `observedSpecRevision > spec.revision` (a lagging spec read, possible across
replica freshness points) as its own signal to re-read the spec key, bounded retries until
caught up or the caller's deadline, never trusting the mismatched pair. Watch delivers
current values then deltas per key; a watcher that falls behind MUST re-read both keys and
resume, never patch forward across a gap. Records are
bounded (§13.8).

**Journal**, an explicitly **untrusted at-least-once submission log** feeding **canonical
accepted-fact subjects** with a mediated writer; effects consume only canonical facts, never
raw submissions.

1. A journaled submission is published to the submission plane (`epj`) as a **plain append**:
   submitters MUST NOT set `Nats-Msg-Id`, and native dedupe is **not relied upon**, the
   server does not accept a zero duplicate window (§13.12), so the reference config sets the
   server minimum and the guarantee rests on the header rule, not the window: a conformant
   submission carries no dedupe header and cannot be suppressed by one. Native broker dedupe
   keys on a caller-set header value compared
   **stream-wide**, so on a shared submissions stream any writer could pre-seed a predicted
   header value from its own allowed subject and silently suppress another caller's first
   submission for a full dedupe window, a cross-caller denial that no "advisory" framing
   makes safe; with the MUST NOT in force, a hostile header-bearing publish can suppress only
   another non-conformant header-bearing write. Transport retries therefore simply append
   again; the caller-scoped decision
   CAS below resolves every copy to one decision. Submission subjects and fact subjects are
   disjoint by construction (§13.2), so a submission credential cannot write a fact.
2. The **semantic fingerprint** covers every effect-defining dimension, the fingerprint
   object is `{endpoint, command,
   class, authz?, target?: {owner, actor, lifecycleUid, mappingRevision?}, inputDigest,
   outputDigest, args, authDigest?, caller: {id, lifecycleUid}, goalId?, id}`, and the
   fingerprint VALUE is that object's `sha256:<hex>` content digest per §13.7 (strict
   RFC 8785 over I-JSON, the SAME canonicalization every contract artifact uses; one
   canonicalizer, never a second): absent optional fields are OMITTED from the object, never
   written `null`, so two implementations digest identical bytes, which also makes the
   fingerprint **computable for EVERY parseable submission**, however incomplete: a
   parseable envelope missing `class` or digests fingerprints the subset it carries and is
   rejected with that fingerprint. **"Parseable" here means canonicalizable I-JSON**, not
   merely syntactically valid JSON: bytes that parse but cannot be canonicalized, duplicate
   object names, a lone surrogate, a non-finite or out-of-I-JSON-range number; have no
   interoperable RFC 8785 form and therefore no fingerprint, so they take the quarantine
   path exactly as unparseable bytes and an invalid `id` do (§13.4 item 3: raw-byte digest,
   no fingerprint). Every submission thus has exactly one terminal path. Same id +
   same fingerprint is the same request (idempotent, first-wins); same id + different
   fingerprint (including the same args retargeted at a different lifecycle) is a loud
   `conflict`, never accepted or effected.
3. The **canonicalizer**, the narrowly scoped mediated writer for this endpoint's facts
   (§13.9); consumes the submission plane through a **normative durable `AckExplicit`
   consumer** and acks a submission ONLY after a durable decision fact exists, and, for a
   pool-admitted acceptance, ONLY after the §13.6 EPW enqueue create has additionally
   succeeded (or lost its CAS to an already-present entry): a crash anywhere between
   acceptance and enqueue therefore redelivers the submission, and the reconciliation
   predicate resolves the redelivered copy; recovery never has to DISCOVER orphaned
   acceptances, because an acceptance without its enqueue is by construction an unacked
   submission that comes back. A crash before
   the fact redelivers the submission; a crash after it observes the CAS winner on
   redelivery. It validates each submission (schema, body/subject agreement incl. the target
   block, authorization per §13.6, and (for work-pool commands) pool admission/capacity
   BEFORE acceptance) and then decides each request exactly once by publishing a
   **decision fact** to the caller-scoped subject
   `epf.<endpoint>.dec.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>` with create-only CAS (expected last
   sequence on the subject = 0), so distinct callers can never squat each other's ids. **For
   an action command the canonicalizer additionally binds the goal before accepting**: it
   create-only-CASes a **goal-bind fact** `epf.<endpoint>.goal.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<goalId>.bind`
   carrying the accepted fingerprint, and rejects (`conflict`) any later submission whose
   `goalId` matches but whose fingerprint differs, so two distinct `id`s naming one `goalId`
   cannot both be accepted-and-effected (the decision CAS keys on `id`, which alone would let
   both through; the goal-bind CAS keys on `goalId`, which stops the second BEFORE acceptance
   and effect, not at the terminal-result stage where the effect has already happened).
   The decision is `accepted` or `rejected` (with the catalog error); **rejection is as
   durable, caller-readable, and idempotent as acceptance**, so a permanently invalid
   submission is distinguishable from a lost one. First decision wins atomically; a later
   attempt fails its CAS and reads the existing fact. There is no append-then-memo pair to
   crash between. The canonicalizer is a **singleton per endpoint** (one active principal,
   epoch-fenced like any serve identity, recovered through the §13.1 takeover barrier):
   admission checks (pool capacity for work-pool commands) are thereby serialized with the
   decisions they gate, so two canonicalizers cannot both admit the last slot; capacity is
   consumed by the acceptance itself, never checked apart from it. A submission that cannot
   yield a decision key; bytes that are not canonicalizable I-JSON (unparseable, duplicate
   object names, lone surrogate, out-of-range number), or no `id` within the token
   grammar; **or bytes that breach the command's declared `admissionCeiling`** (§13.7): raw
   size over `maxBytes`, nesting over `maxDepth`, or member count over `maxItems`; is
   **quarantined, never redelivered forever**: the canonicalizer publishes a
   **`QuarantineFact`** to the disjoint quarantine family
   `epf.<endpoint>.quar.<sourceSeq>` (§13.2); keyed by the source sequence, which exists
   for every stored copy by construction, in a family that shares no namespace with
   caller-chosen `dec` ids, so no legal request id can collide with a quarantine key, with
   create-only CAS, and terminally acks
   (`AckTerm`) the submission ONLY after that fact durably exists (or its CAS loss shows it
   already does), so a poison message cannot pin `MaxAckPending` and the
   fact-before-terminal-ack rule holds on the poison path exactly as on the decision path.
   `QuarantineFact` = `{ v: 1, decision: "quarantined", sourceSeq, submissionDigest (the
   `sha256:<hex>` digest of the raw stored bytes, §13.7), error: { code (catalog token),
   detail? (≤ 256 bytes) }, caller?: { id, lifecycleUid } (from the broker-authenticated
   submission subject, when it parses), ts }`, every field bounded or fixed-size, so the
   fact fits by construction; it never carries the poison bytes themselves.
4. Journal submissions set `replyExpected: false`; the caller **observes its decision** by
   watching/reading its own decision subtree (`epf.<endpoint>.dec.<its triple>.>`, a
   caller-scoped read grant minted with every journal capability). An action command's
   accept/reject is exactly its decision fact, expected within the submission deadline.
5. The **acceptance fact is self-sufficient for effect and replay** (`AcceptanceFact`, the
   `accepted` decision): `{ v: 1, id, decision: "accepted", fingerprint, request: <the
   canonical EndpointRequest, args INLINE, bounded by the broker's max_payload; a submission
   too large is refused loudly with resource-exhausted, never spilled into storage>, caller:
   {id, lifecycleUid}, target?: {owner, actor, lifecycleUid, mappingRevision},
   contractDigests: {input, output}, authzDecision: {revision, epoch},
   route: "effects" | `pool.<pool>` (the acceptance's SINGLE execution route, decided by
   the canonicalizer at admission: a pool-routed acceptance is executed by the pool's
   worker path (§13.5) and the effects consumers MUST ack it without effect; an
   effects-routed acceptance is executed by exactly one instance off the shared effects
   durable (§13.9). No acceptance is ever executed twice, because the fact names its route),
   readinessDeadlineMs?: <the acceptance-relative readiness bound, present iff the command
   declares bounded readiness, §13.6; persisted HERE because it is goal state, not the
   request's decision deadline>,
   workExpiry?: <absolute expiry of a pool-routed item, present iff `route` is a pool, §13.8;
   survives reconciliation re-enqueue unchanged>, sourceSeq, ts }`. A `target`-bearing
   acceptance (work bound to a lifecycle) publishes ONLY after its target-indexed
   obligation row exists AND only under an unexpired admission proof the mediator issued
   for that row (§13.8: proof issuance is the post-create currency recheck, so a row whose
   target or policy moved between create and recheck never admits; the fact's durable
   address is caller-scoped, so the obligation row, keyed target-first, is the ONLY
   target-enumerable record a retirement barrier can drain;
   `target.mappingRevision` is provenance, never a fence). The
   canonicalizer preflights the **serialized decision fact**, not merely the inline args,
   against `max_payload`: a submission whose acceptance fact would not fit is rejected
   `resource-exhausted`, and the rejection fact always fits by construction: every field
   is bounded or fixed-size (the operator floor assertion covers the maximum serialized
   rejection/quarantine fact, §13.12):
   `RejectionFact` = `{ v: 1, id, decision: "rejected", fingerprint, error: { code (catalog
   token), detail? (≤ 256 bytes) }, caller: {id, lifecycleUid}, authzDecision?: {revision,
   epoch}, sourceSeq,
   ts }`; the fingerprint and the catalog error, never the args (a parseable submission
   always yields the fingerprint; the unparseable/no-id case is the QuarantineFact above,
   which requires neither `id` nor `fingerprint`). Digest-pinned
   references inside a fact may name **only already-published public contract artifacts**,
   never per-request payloads: the contract store is public, immutable, and permanent,
   the opposite lifecycle of private, horizon-bounded request content (a large-payload
   facility, if ever needed, is its own future primitive with its own store, retention, and
   §13.9 rows). Effects and replay read the fact, never the raw submission (a TOCTOU re-read
   of the untrusted log is non-conformant).
6. Decision facts/tombstones are retained at least the declared **idempotency horizon**
   (default 24h, space-configurable) AND longer than the maximum submission-log retention
   plus recovery/redelivery lag; otherwise a rebuilt canonicalizer could re-accept an old
   submission still sitting in the log as new work. The horizon is **realized by decision
   retention, not by a clock**: the create-only CAS returns the recorded decision for exactly
   as long as the fact exists, and a reused id becomes new work only once retention has
   evicted the old fact and freed its subject; there is no separate time rule for the CAS
   to disagree with. The §13.12 retention floor states the horizon by OUTCOME: no removal
   cause may drop a decision fact or tombstone before it. The canonical subjects are the authority (D12) for anything
   auditable, metered, compensated, effected, or replayed. Ordering is per-subject;
   consumers never assume cross-subject order.

**Events are not facts.** Cluster events and per-goal progress (`epe`) are direct,
epoch-fenced, instance-published notifications on a durable, ordered, replayable stream;
that is the sense in which they ride the journal contract. They do NOT pass through the
canonicalizer, carry no acceptance semantics, and MUST NOT drive effects that require
canonical acceptance; anything auditable/metered/compensated goes through submissions and
facts.

### 13.5 Verbs

- **call**, bounded request/reply (`replyExpected: true`, `deadlineMs` mandatory). On the
  `one` rail it is queue-group anycast; on `inst` it addresses one stable instance. No
  responder → `unavailable`.
- **cast**, the same subjects and grants (`replyExpected: false`): fire-and-forget,
  at-most-once, the responder MUST NOT reply and the caller never reads the rail (the nonce
  is present but unused). A cast to a journaled command is `class-mismatch`; journaled work
  goes through submissions.
- **watch**; observe a record (KV watch; fell-behind ⇒ re-read, §13.4) or an event topic
  (live subscription within the read grant plus filtered replay from the event stream).
  Per-key and per-goal subjects carry read containment; a watch grant names the exact subtree.
- **claim**, competitive at-most-one-winner acquisition from a durable work pool (`epw`),
  **owner-mediated**: the pool's owning endpoint holds the pool's single `AckExplicit` pull
  consumer (§13.12); workers hold **no** JetStream grant on the pool and acquire, renew, and
  settle work exclusively through the owning endpoint's reserved **`lease`** and **`commit`**
  commands on the ordinary `ep` rails. This is the only shape that satisfies both claim
  invariants at once: the delivery's ack token never leaves the party allowed to use it, and
  the attempt binding is **owner-recorded at assignment** rather than asserted by the worker
  (a worker-carried "sequence + attempt" proves nothing about delivery; an owner assignment
  does). The stored pool message is **work identity and input only, never the authoritative
  lease**: broker redelivery re-delivers the same stored bytes, so a token in the payload
  cannot fence, and the consumer's `ack_wait` is the broker's redelivery-to-owner timer only,
  never the lease. `lease` (call): the owner fetches the next stored item and records the
  lease `{item, sourceSeq, attempt: the delivery count, worker: the broker-authenticated
  caller (principal + lifecycle UID, plus epoch for endpoint workers), fencingToken,
  leaseDeadline}` in its `lease` record (key grammar §13.7, writer table §13.9) by
  **first-wins idempotent CAS per (item, attempt)**, a duplicate or
  delayed `lease` call for a still-current attempt returns the SAME lease; an attempt is
  superseded once redelivery advances the delivery count; `fencingToken` is CAS-incremented
  per attempt and `leaseDeadline` comes from the owner's own clock. Expiry revokes the claim
  at that deadline even before reassignment. Every Cotal-owned commit from claimed work is
  submitted through the reserved **`commit` command** carrying the exact lease tuple; the
  handler validates token currency AND unexpired lease against its own clock AND that the
  caller is the lease's bound worker, then performs an **atomic, idempotent per-item CAS to
  a cached terminal result**, the per-item terminal fact
  `epf.<endpoint>.wrk.<pool>.<acceptance identity>` (§13.2), create-only CAS per item,
  under its mediated writer credential (§13.9): a committed item
  can never be leased again, a duplicate commit returns the cached terminal outcome, and a
  raced commit loses loudly. Only after observing the committed terminal state does the
  owner ack the WorkQueue message; it holds the delivery natively, so the deletion
  capability is never transferred, and no worker-side ack can destroy an item whose commit
  was rejected. A lost owner ack merely redelivers the item to the owner, which observes the
  committed terminal state and acks again: **settled work is never re-enqueued as new** (the
  durable bridge is the acceptance fact plus the per-item terminal CAS; an accepted item
  with no terminal result and no live pool entry is the only re-enqueueable state, §13.6). A
  stale token, expired lease, or superseded worker is `expired`/`conflict`; workers hold no
  bypass write.
- **scatter**, a request on the `all` rail. The caller freezes a **request-scoped expected
  set**, the live instances of the class from the service registry, each as
  `(instanceId, registrationRevision, epoch)`, where `registrationRevision` is the store
  revision of the instance's `svc….spec` record key (§13.7: it advances only on mediated
  registration writes, and the record read/watch grant that freezes it is a §13.9 matrix
  row), at send time. Gather accepts at most one
  terminal reply per expected `instanceId`, attributed from the reply subject **including its
  epoch** (§13.2): a second reply from the same `(instanceId, epoch)` is classified
  `duplicate` and **reported, never silently dropped** (first reply wins); a reply from a
  frozen `instanceId` at a different epoch, or an observed registration-revision advance;
  is classified `churn` (the instance restarted mid-scatter and may never have seen the
  request) and does not count toward completion; replies from outside the frozen set are
  classified `unexpected` and never count toward completion. Completion is
  all-expected-replied or deadline, in which case the result is explicitly partial with
  `missing` / `churn` / `unexpected` / `duplicate` / `late` classifications (a churned slot
  reports as `churn`, not `missing`). An empty or unreadable registry is
  `failed-precondition`, not an empty success. Deadline mandatory.

### 13.6 Composites

Patterns over the verbs and contracts; zero new transport.

**Action**, a long-running command. `action` is a command **marker**, never a class: an
action command's submissions are `class: journal` (§13.3).

1. The caller submits with a client-generated `goalId` and the request fingerprint (§13.4).
   Accept/reject is the durable decision fact (§13.4), expected within the submission's
   decision deadline; there is no reply-rail answer to recover.
   **Authorization linearizes at acceptance**: the acceptance fact persists the caller and
   target lifecycle tuples, command + contract digests, and the authorization decision
   revision/epoch it was made under. A scope narrowing before acceptance rejects the goal;
   after acceptance it blocks *new* goals but an accepted goal continues, unless the
   command's contract declares **continuous reauthorization**, in which case each declared
   checkpoint re-validates and deterministically transitions to `cancelling`/`failed`
   (`permission-denied`) on narrowing. Handle expiry/revocation mid-goal follows the same
   declared policy.
2. States: `accepted → running ⇄ waiting → succeeded | failed | cancelled | expired |
   uncertain`, with
   `cancelling` between a cancel and its terminal state. This is the **single status
   vocabulary** for every long-running surface. All five of `succeeded`, `failed`,
   `cancelled`, `expired`, and `uncertain` (item 6) are **terminal**, and first-terminal-fact-wins
   applies uniformly: `uncertain` is not an absence of an outcome, it is the outcome
   "this action's success signal did not arrive within its readiness deadline".
3. Progress rides per-goal events (`epe…goal.<caller triple>.<goalId>.progress`), read-scoped
   to the caller at mint time. The goal's current state is a status-only record projection;
   the journal owns the facts.
4. Cancel is the reserved `cancel` command: `graceful` (compensations, default) or
   `terminate`. Cancel of an unknown/terminal goal is `failed-precondition` with the cached
   outcome attached. Cancel races completion at the mediated commit point: first terminal
   fact wins; the loser observes it.
5. The terminal result is a journal fact and is cached. The full payload is retained at least
   the declared result retention (default 24h); a **terminal tombstone**
   `{goalId, fingerprint, state, outcomeDigest}` at least the idempotency horizon (≥ result
   retention; outcome-stated by the §13.12 retention floor). Same goalId + fingerprint returns the cached outcome (after payload eviction:
   the tombstone summary, `data.evicted: true`); same goalId + different fingerprint is
   `conflict`; beyond the horizon a reused goalId is explicitly new work.
6. **Bounded readiness (`uncertain`).** An action whose success signal may lawfully not
   arrive within its readiness bound declares a **readiness deadline**, a distinct,
   acceptance-relative bound persisted in the acceptance fact/goal state, NOT the
   submission's `deadlineMs` (which bounds only the decision, §13.3). Spawn readiness is
   the reference case: its readiness deadline is **30 s**, the migrated presence-or-exit
   backstop, D29; every legacy spawn-timeout consumer converges on this single bound. When
   the deadline passes without the signal, the owner records the goal's terminal **result
   fact** (`goal….result`, §13.2) with the outcome
   `uncertain`, and the goal IS terminal: `uncertain` is a terminal outcome like
   `succeeded`/`failed`, immutable, first-terminal-fact-wins as for any goal (there is no
   call and no reply rail here: an action is a journal submission, and the result fact IS
   the caller-visible outcome, item 5). The underlying ENTITY's later convergence
   (ready/exited) is observable on that entity's own status record (`svc….status`, the
   lifecycle mapping); a caller that needs the eventual answer watches the entity, never
   the goal; the goal is not rewritten and its status does not linger non-terminal.
7. Goals bind the target's `(principal, lifecycleUid)` (§13.1): a goal accepted against a
   lifecycle is not redeemable, cancellable, or effectful against a same-name successor. A
   restarted instance (same `instanceId`/UID, advanced epoch) recovers its goals from journal
   + records; a superseded epoch cannot commit transitions.

**Awaitable checkpoint**; one durable pause primitive (approvals, guard holds, payment
authorization). A waiting action mints a checkpoint: a durable token persisted with the goal,
a `waiting` status carrying the checkpoint id and its **deadline generation**, and a durable
timer (§13.12). Deadlines are mandatory. Heartbeat/extension CAS-advances the generation in
status, then replaces the timer (a new `.schedule` request; the mediated timer writer's
same-subject `.armed` publish is the server rollup, §13.2/§13.12, the 2.14 atomic
stop-plus-publish is NOT assumed at the 2.12 floor). A firing timer carries
`(timerId, generation)`; the endpoint validates the generation against current status before
acting, stale fires **no-op**. Because status and timer are two resources with no atomic
bridge, a **durable reconciler** on the owning endpoint repairs the pair after crash or
leadership change WITHOUT any status↔schedule read the no-read timer plane cannot serve: the
reconciler **re-emits a `.schedule` request at the current generation for every `waiting`
status it owns**, and a same-`(timerId, generation)` arm is **idempotent at the timer writer**
(it re-derives the same `.armed` message; a duplicate is a no-op replacement), so
over-emission is harmless and a missing schedule is repaired without the reconciler ever
having to observe whether one exists. Stale-generation fires still no-op at the handler. Cancellation of a timer is cleanup, never the correctness boundary.
Timer retention MUST exceed the maximum deadline plus a recovery margin. Resume: a `resume`
command presenting the checkpoint token; resume authorization is **one-use** (journaled by
create-only CAS on the checkpoint token; duplicate resume is `conflict`) and holder-bound
(§13.10). Expiry fails the checkpoint closed.

A settlement MAY name the answer it accepted. The one-use settle fact carries an OPTIONAL
`answerId`, and the status carries the matching OPTIONAL `settledAnswerId`; both are id tokens,
both are permitted ONLY on a `resumed` settlement, and an implementation MUST reject either on an
expiry. Their key sets are closed: an endpoint that does not know these keys MUST hard-error on a
fact that carries one. The answer's payload MUST NOT ride either field.

**Guard checkpoint**, the pre-effect authorization hook. A command carrying the governed
`ai.cotal.guarded` trait MUST NOT effect until the guard endpoint named by the trait value
answered **allow** (class call). Answers: `allow | deny | hold` plus optional signed
obligations (attenuations the endpoint MUST apply; monotonic). `hold` converts the action to
`waiting` on a checkpoint owned by the guard decision. Timeout or unreachable guard is
**deny** (fail closed). Ordering is guard-then-effect. Side-effecting guards own their own
reconciliation.

**Capability handle**, the one passable reference type: a signed JSON grant, RFC 8785
canonical, Ed25519-signed by a key in the trust-anchor registry (§13.10):

`{ v: 1, id, space, issuer: { keyId }, holder: { id, lifecycleUid }, grants: [{ endpoint,
instanceId?, commands: [{ name, authz?, targetOwner?, targetActor?, targetLifecycleUid? }],
reads?: [<record-key or event-topic subtree>] }], iat, nbf?, exp, parentDigest?, sturdy,
epoch?, sig }`

A grant entry carries **every subject-level dimension** a capability has (§13.9): a targeted
command names its authorization mode and target components; read scopes name exact
record-key / event-topic subtrees. The per-command target tuple is a **closed set of three
legal shapes**, no target components; `targetOwner` alone; or the full triple
`{targetOwner, targetActor, targetLifecycleUid}`, and **every other combination is
schema-invalid** (`contract-invalid`): in particular `targetActor` without
`targetLifecycleUid` (a handle that pins a recyclable alias component MUST pin the lifecycle
it means) and `targetLifecycleUid` without `targetActor` (a lifecycle restriction with no
compile target would otherwise be silently DROPPED into an owner-wide grant, a partial
tuple never weakens into a broader one). The normative compiler maps a grant entry to
exactly the subjects the equivalent minted capability would receive (never wider) it MUST
consume every present signed component (a component the compile target cannot express is
schema-invalid, never ignored), and every legal entry HAS a compile target:

- a **no-target** entry compiles to the untargeted or `self` form per the command's
  contract; an `authz` field on it is schema-invalid.
- an **owner-domain** entry (`targetOwner` alone) compiles to the mode its `authz` field
  names, `owner` (the default), `child`, or `ledger`, and NOTHING else: each pins the
  signed `targetOwner` in that mode's own subject form (§13.2), **never collapsing `child`
  or `ledger` to `owner`** (the modes are distinct validator-primary rails and rewriting
  one into another widens authority), and **`authz: "any"` is schema-invalid in a handle
  grant entry** (`contract-invalid`): the `any` rail is operator-ceiling authority, minted
  only as a standing capability under an operator-scoped anchor (§13.10), never conferred
  or attenuated through a handle; a compiler therefore has no `any` case, and no
  implementation choice exists between rejecting, literalizing, or widening it.
- an **actor-pinned** entry (the full triple) compiles to the `handle`-mode form pinning the
  full signed triple `<targetOwner>.<targetActor>.<targetLifecycleUid>` (§13.2); an `authz`
  field on it is schema-invalid (the triple IS the mode).
- an **instance** entry compiles to
  the exact `ep.inst` rails; complete, because `(endpoint, instanceId)` is the whole instance
  address and instance ids are never reused (§13.1).

A capability that cannot be represented in this shape MUST
NOT be carried by a handle.

- **Two uses, both fail-closed.** *Attenuation:* presented in the `auth` slot, a handle only
  narrows; the handler enforces `effective = presenter-cred ∩ handle.grants ∩
  issuer-authority`, and additionally requires any signed target triple to match the
  request's target and the current mapping (`expired` on mismatch); it never confers broker
  reach. *Conferral:* a handle grants reach only by **redemption through the trusted auth
  path** (the exchange/callout of §9/§10), which verifies the signed target triple against
  the current mapping **at redemption time** (`expired` on mismatch) and mints a short-lived
  credential whose grants are the intersection of issuer authority, handle grants, and the
  redeeming holder's current lifecycle + credential; actor-pinned grants compile to
  `handle`-mode subjects carrying the verified triple (§13.2), so a target lifecycle that
  rotates after mint is caught by the endpoint's currency check; no handler-side widening
  exists. The minted credential is **ledgered before release** in the credential ledger
  (§13.1), keyed under the redeeming holder's lifecycle with the FULL presented handle
  chain as its `sourceChain` (plus the per-ancestor `bysrc.` index keys), so
  takeover/retirement barriers revoke it with the family and revoking ANY handle in its
  lineage (parent or leaf) cascades to it. Chain verification itself checks the
  revocation status of EVERY sturdy link in the chain, not only the presented leaf,
  failing closed on any revoked ancestor.
- **Holder-bound:** `holder` names the one `(principal, lifecycleUid)` that may present or
  redeem it; bearer transfer exists only as an explicit issuer-signed re-issue. `space` binds
  it to one space. A recycled alias cannot present its predecessor's handles (UID mismatch).
- **Attenuation chain:** `parentDigest` references the parent handle; a child MUST be ⊆ its
  parent under the **normative containment order**, per grant entry: endpoint within the
  parent's endpoint/domain pattern; `instanceId` equal or newly pinned (never widened to
  absent); commands a name-subset with per-command mode never higher in `self < owner < any`
  (`child`/`ledger`/`handle` are grantable only where the parent names the same mode); target
  components equal or newly pinned; read subtrees subject-prefix-contained, and per
  envelope: same `space`, validity window within the parent's, `sturdy` only if the parent is
  sturdy. The issuer of a child is the parent's holder, anchor-registered with a `handles`
  role whose scope covers the child (§13.10); the same containment order defines issuer-scope
  coverage. Presentation carries the full chain inline (`parentDigest`-linked artifacts
  presented together, no ambient fetch); verification walks every link to a registered
  anchor, failing closed on widening, unknown/revoked keys, or expiry.
- **Sturdy vs live:** live handles (`sturdy: false`) bind the current process `epoch`, are
  never persisted, `exp ≤ 24h`, and die on restart. Sturdy handles bind the lifecycle UID
  (surviving supervised restart), persist as issuer-namespaced `handle.<issuerKeyId>.<id>`
  records (spec create-only; status = revocation state, monotonic; §13.9 writer table), and
  verifiers MUST check revocation (fail closed if unreadable). Max sturdy TTL is
  space-configured (default 30d).
- Handles are reusable within TTL unless a composite declares one-use (checkpoint resume);
  the replay matrix of §13.10 governs every signed artifact.

**Session (bidirectional stream)**, the generic composite for interactive byte/frame
streams (terminal attach is its first consumer; nothing terminal-specific is normative). It
is exactly D26's cast-ingress + watch-egress composed over dedicated per-session subjects,
no new verb and no new transport: the `in` subject is a cast-only rail (caller publishes,
endpoint subscribes) and the `out` subject is a watch rail (endpoint publishes, caller
subscribes). A session is established by an ordinary command whose answer is a **session
grant**: a one-use,
holder-bound handle (live: bound to the caller's lifecycle AND current process epoch,
live authority dies on restart, §13.1, so redemption fresh-checks the holder epoch and an
unredeemed grant does not survive the caller's restart, plus the serving instance epoch) naming a fresh
unguessable `sessionId` and the epoch-pinned session subjects
`eps.<endpoint>.<sessionId>.<epoch>.in` (caller → endpoint) and `….out` (endpoint → caller).
Session subjects are **core-only**, never stream-captured; the bounded flow window lives in
memory and a dropped frame is the composite's problem, not retention's. Redemption mints
exact asymmetric per-session credentials: the caller publishes `in` and subscribes `out`;
the serving instance the reverse; no third party holds either, and no standing wildcard EPS
grant exists. Frames are opaque; flow control is bounded (window declared in the grant;
overflow is `resource-exhausted`, never unbounded buffering). Close is explicit, and
revocation has a **durable** named authority that survives the
serving endpoint: the trusted auth path (the exchange/callout of §9/§10) persists a **session
ledger row** at redemption, key `session.<sessionId>` in the auth store (§13.12), value
`{sessionId, endpoint, serving instance + epoch, holder (principal + lifecycleUid), both
minted credential ids, per-credential revocation marks, state, exp}` (the endpoint is in the
row because an `instanceId` is unique only within its endpoint, so every serving-party
operation authenticates against the full serving identity the row pins), create-only CAS per
`sessionId` (this CAS IS the one-use
redemption), state monotonic
(`active → closed | expired | superseded | retired`, all terminal), and each per-session
credential is simultaneously a credential-ledger row under its holder's lifecycle (§13.1),
which is the index the §13.1 barriers enumerate, and a barrier that revokes a
session-sourced credential MUST resolve its `session.<sessionId>` row, transition it
terminal, and revoke BOTH per-session credentials, so either side's takeover or retirement
tears down the whole pair, not its own half. Redemption's writes are ordered by a **finalize CAS**, so no half-issued session is ever
usable: the create-CAS writes the session row in state `issuing` (this create IS the
one-use), then both per-session credential rows are written gate-checked (§13.1), then the
redemption **CAS-finalizes the session row `issuing → active`**, fresh-checking BOTH the
holder and serving process epochs and both lifecycle gates at that CAS, and releases the two
credentials only on finalize success. A credential is authority ONLY once its session row is
`active`; an `issuing` row confers nothing. Close/expiry/either barrier CAS the row to a
terminal state (`closed`/`expired`/`superseded`/`retired`) and revoke both credential ids by
name (the ids are known from the row, whether or not both credentials were released) so a
crash mid-issue leaves an `issuing` row that the expiry sweep collects (revoking both ids and
tombstoning), never a live half-pair, and a redemption racing a close loses its finalize CAS
and releases nothing. A revocation mark is set only by a revoke that SUCCEEDED; a terminal
row with an unmarked credential is retried by every later sweep pass, exactly the unconfirmed
ids, until both marks confirm, so a transient revocation failure can never quietly leave half
a pair alive. The auth path revokes BOTH per-session
credentials with eviction (bounded
propagation) on any of: an **authenticated close input** on the trusted auth path itself,
a defined operation of the SAME exchange/callout surface that redemption already uses
(§9/§10, off-broker, so no broker grant row applies): the caller authenticates as one of
the session's two parties (its lifecycle or per-session credential) or as the operator and
names the `sessionId`; the auth path verifies party membership against the ledger row
before transitioning it. The in-band close frame
is an advisory peer signal, never the revocation authority, because EPS subjects are
core-only and captured by nothing; expiry per the handle rules (`exp` is enforced by the
auth path's own timer, not by the endpoint), or the serving
epoch's supersession / lifecycle retirement via the §13.1 barriers (either side's lifecycle:
holder and serving rows both index the family). Neither side can keep a
half-closed session alive, and a crashed serving endpoint cannot orphan one, the ledger, not
the endpoint, remembers what to revoke. Ledger rows are retained at least the maximum
session `exp` plus a recovery margin. The session dies with the serving instance's epoch
(the epoch is in the subject, so a restarted instance cannot resume it; a durable session is
a new establishment). Routing is authenticated broker routing end to end; there is no loopback URL
or out-of-band transport in the contract, and cross-machine reachability is exactly broker
reachability.

**Remote manager service registration.** A remote registered user becomes a manager only through
one host-operated, typed `prepare → activate → renew` exchange. It is not a generic credential
mint surface and is available only on the loopback/operator face to a signed-in human holding the
closed `manager-service` view (§13.1); the public exchange and managed-agent secret exchange
refuse every stage. All inputs and stored stage records are closed schemas. An operation is keyed
by `{ owner, managerActor, lifecycleUid, instanceId, operationId }`, where `managerActor` and the
lifecycle UID come from the server-authorized view, `instanceId` is opaque and collision-resistant,
and `operationId` is caller-generated for replay convergence. A repeated operation with the same
fingerprint returns its recorded result; a different fingerprint at the same coordinate is
`conflict`; a retired lifecycle or instance is never revived.

`prepare` fresh-checks the ledger scope and lifecycle, freezes only
`epgate.manager.<instanceId>`, and durably stages the exact service registration, contract closure,
status coordinate, requested public nkey, and credential lifetime. It releases no usable material.
`activate` re-checks that same live ledger row and gate, creates the exact `svc.manager.<instanceId>`
registration, publishes only the staged immutable contract artifacts, and asks the host to sign
NATS JWT material for that public nkey. The host writes the matching
`epcred.manager.<instanceId>.<credentialId>` row before the gate-finalize CAS and returns the JWT
only after that CAS; it never returns a signing seed. `renew` is the only way to obtain successor
public-nkey JWT material. It re-checks the live `supervise` grant, owner, actor, lifecycle,
instance, current gate, and bounded renewal window, then records and releases a replacement under
the same family. It cannot create another instance or broaden a staged contract, record, endpoint,
or credential grant. A crashed operation resumes only from its durable stage and operation id.

Renewal is bounded and denial is fail-closed. When a manager cannot renew because its login,
ledger scope, or host service is unavailable, it reports degraded state, retains already-live
agents only while their independently valid authority remains usable, and refuses new starts,
restarts, replacement credentials, and unsafe recovery. It MUST NOT turn a transient failure into
static authority or kill a live agent merely to make the state look healthy. When the current
family expires or is revoked, the host's verified revocation path closes it; a later restart still
requires a new successful prepare/activate operation. Same-owner descendant provisioning is
host-validated at every request, and loss of that validation also refuses a new start or restart.

**Virtual endpoints.** An endpoint MAY be virtual: registered (`spec.activation = on-demand`)
with no live instance. A virtual endpoint's commands MUST be journal-class: the buffered
ingress path is the ordinary submission plane (`epj` is durable and needs no live
subscriber), and the canonicalizer, which for a virtual endpoint runs wherever its
activator/owning authority runs, checks pool admission BEFORE deciding (an over-capacity
submission is rejected `resource-exhausted` as its durable decision fact, never accepted and
stranded), then accepts and enqueues the work into the endpoint's `epw` pool. Admission
occupancy is the pool consumer's `num_pending + num_ack_pending`, read fresh from the exact
per-pool consumer INFO after reconciling the canonicalizer's own outstanding acceptances
against the predicate below (a repaired item is inside the count new work competes under);
the read fails closed (an unreadable consumer is `unavailable`, never an empty pool), and the
sum is honest only while the pool consumer's delivery ceiling is unlimited
(`max_deliver = -1`) AND its filter is exactly the pool's own subtree; BOTH are editable after
creation, so both are pinned at creation AND re-proved at every read (a message that exhausts
a finite ceiling stays stored but leaves both counters; a narrowed or foreign filter reads
empty while stored work remains). The admission capacity comes from the endpoint's REGISTERED
activation policy (declared as the registration's `spec.activation` block, a closed schema
whose `capacity` is required; the registration path publishes each version as an immutable
`policy` record, §13.7, and the govern head's selector below names the enforced one), READ
leader-served at each decision (the read is FENCING by use, so a
follower Direct Get is never used; a scoped canonicalizer executes it only through the
confined policy reader of §13.8, whose request subject binds the authenticated endpoint)
and its enforced revision RE-PROVEN after the decision's
later reads and carried into the acceptance commit, never a free-standing argument; the
carried revision is provenance, and the FENCE against the policy or lifecycle moving while
the acceptance is in flight is the §13.8 obligation row, not the carried value. The
**endpoint-wide policy coordinate** is not a new head: it is the governance head
`govern.<endpoint>` (§13.7, the endpoint's registration linearization point). To make the
enforced policy MACHINE-SELECTABLE by any second implementer (not inferable from prose), the
govern head value carries a normative **policy selector**: `{ enforcedPolicyKey (the exact
records key of the immutable `policy` record currently governing, §13.7), enforcedPolicyRevision
(that record's STORE revision), pendingPolicyKey?, pendingPolicyRevision? }`. A canonicalizer reads
govern leader-served, follows `enforcedPolicyKey`, and re-proves it is still at
`enforcedPolicyRevision`, with no per-instance guesswork; `policyRevision` throughout this
section IS `enforcedPolicyRevision`. **`enforcedPolicyKey` MUST name an IMMUTABLE,
REVISION-ADDRESSED policy record, not a mutable per-instance slot** (a bare
`svc.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.spec` overwritten on every re-registration is disqualified: the
records bucket keeps history 1, so once a mutation overwrites it the OLD `enforcedPolicyRevision`
can no longer be read, and the drain window's claim that "the old policy keeps governing" would
be unbacked). The normative immutable form is the **`policy` record kind** (§13.7):
`policy.<endpoint>.<digest-hex>`, one unsplit, create-only, NEVER-DELETED key per policy
version, where `<digest-hex>` is the SHA-256 hex of the record's canonical value bytes: the
key is self-certifying (a reader re-digests the value and refuses a mismatch), so a
different-byte overwrite is caught on read, and BOTH the enforced and the pending revisions
stay readable throughout the drain. Immutability is upheld by the sole writer's create-only
CAS plus that read-time self-certification, not a broker-level subtraction (§13.9). A
deployment that cannot provide an immutable policy key MUST pause admission during the
mutation rather than claim the old value remains readable.
A policy mutation is a re-registration under the frozen registration gate that lands in TWO
fenced govern-head CAS steps (§13.9): (1) **stage** records the new registration as
`pendingPolicy{Key,Revision}` (a NEW immutable policy key) while `enforcedPolicy...` still
points at the OLD immutable record, so
the old policy keeps governing and stays readable; (2) **promote**, only after the mutation has **drained the
endpoint's unresolved obligations to quiescence** (§13.8: enumerate `oblig.*.<endpoint>.>`,
settle every unresolved row pinning an older `enforcedPolicyRevision` through its decision
coordinate, re-enumerate until none remain), moves `pendingPolicy...` into `enforcedPolicy...`
and clears the pending slot. Admission always pins the CURRENT `enforcedPolicyRevision`,
and **while a `pendingPolicy…` is staged, proof issuance for policy-admitted decisions
REFUSES** (`failed-precondition`: the endpoint is inside its drain window; target-bound-only
admissions are unaffected). The pause is what makes the drain CONVERGE under load and makes
§13.8's rule (a row created after the drain's final enumeration can never admit) hold for
policy movement exactly as it holds for retirement; rows admitted BEFORE the stage keep their
pinned old revision readable through the immutable key, so no admission is ever judged
against a policy it did not pin. The stage/drain/promote order is a durable, resumable
govern-head sequence, never an implied transaction. The **restart-status commit is the same two-coordinate
class**: before its status CAS the supervisor obtains a `self`-class obligation (§13.8)
through the same mediator, pinning the `enforcedPolicyRevision` its thresholds were read
under AND the complete commit intent `{ commitKey, commitBaseRevision, commitValue, commitDigest }`
of the
status record it will write; the status CAS is authorized only while that obligation is
`accepted`, so a policy or lifecycle movement settles the obligation and the delayed commit
loses a CAS, and a crash after `accepted` is finished deterministically from the pinned
intent (§13.8 recovery), never a
carried-revision comparison. The
restart-intensity thresholds are read leader-served from the SAME registered policy, so neither
a caller nor a follower-stale read can loosen the window to suppress an escalation. A command
name is declared ONCE across the whole closure; a cross-cluster duplicate is an ambiguous
surface and registration refuses it, and a command declared non-journal-class in ANY cluster is
non-journal for the on-demand registration check. The supervisor-owned status fields (the
restart history and the retirement mark) and the `escalated` state can be ORIGINATED only
under the supervisor's DISTINCT WRITE AUTHORITY (a package-private branded capability held by
the restart-note and the escalation reconciler, never an ambiently-mintable factory or the mere
presence of a revision pin): an instance-side status write, whether it creates the first status
or updates a later one, has them stripped and cannot originate `escalated`. The restart history
and retirement mark are validated at every read boundary (a unique-epoch history, an integer
mark present only on an escalated row), and a DEL/PURGE status marker fails closed on the
retirement path (a deletion is never clean absence). Every status write operates on a validated DETACHED snapshot
taken before its first read, so a caller mutating a shared status object mid-write cannot split
the authenticated coordinate from the stored bytes. The activator's reply authority is its
own CONNECTION-SCOPED inbox (`_INBOX_<connId>.>`), never the account-wide default, and its
occupancy read re-proves the pool consumer's ack policy and pull mode alongside its editable
delivery ceiling and filter (a delete/recreate must not substitute a semantically different
consumer). A supervision clock behind the newest recorded restart is refused before the
duplicate-note short-circuit, so a rolled-back clock never returns a stale count. The virtual endpoint's canonicalizer durable serializes admission
(`max_ack_pending = 1`): one submission is in the count-decide-enqueue path at a time, so two
submissions cannot both observe the same free slot; because MaxAckPending is also editable
after creation, every admission re-proves the live pin and refuses on drift rather than
deciding under a serialization it no longer has; pool-worker execution concurrency is an
independent knob, already inside the count via `num_ack_pending`. A virtual endpoint's
registration REFUSES if any declared command is not journal-class (an ephemeral surface
cannot exist with no live instance). Acceptance and
enqueue span two streams with no atomic bridge, so the enqueue is **idempotent, keyed by the
acceptance identity, and reconciled against a decidable predicate**: the pool subject carries
the acceptance identity and the enqueue is a create (expected-last-sequence-for-subject 0),
so a duplicate enqueue loses its CAS harmlessly; because the pool owner acks only after the
committed terminal state (§13.5), an acceptance fact **with** a terminal result is settled
and never re-enqueued, and an acceptance fact with **no** terminal result and **no** live
pool entry (a FENCING absence: the probe is the leader-served `STREAM.MSG.GET` last-by-subject
read of the §13.9 work-pool reconciliation row, never a follower-servable Direct Get, because a stale
follower miss would re-arm settled work) is unambiguously never-enqueued-or-lost, the
only re-enqueueable state. A crash after the acceptance CAS but before the enqueue is
repaired by exactly that predicate; an enqueue without an acceptance fact cannot occur
because only the canonicalizer holds the pool-write grant and it enqueues only from its own
accepted decisions. The stored item bytes are the CANONICAL derivation of the acceptance —
the RFC-8785 canonical JSON of exactly `{ v: 1, id, fingerprint, sourceSeq, workExpiry,
caller, request }` (work identity + input only; never a lease, token, or decision metadata) —
so any two conforming writers (a first enqueue and a crash repair) produce BYTE-IDENTICAL
items, and the create's same-subject-same-bytes idempotency holds across them; a differing
body under the same acceptance identity is a mixup and refuses loud. An ephemeral
call to a virtual endpoint with no live instance is an honest `unavailable`; nothing
silently buffers it. An **activator** (holder of its activation capability) watches the pool
and starts an instance; single-writer per identity is fenced by instance-record CAS +
epoch. The exact consumer INFO the activator watches is a request/reply snapshot with no
broker wakeup, so watching is bounded polling with backoff to a finite maximum interval, and
an INFO failure is loud, never a silent skipped poll; the activator's broker authority is
exactly that INFO read plus its mediated, target-bound start seam (no pool consume/ack, no
stream read, no consumer create/update/delete). Passivation drains, updates status, exits;
durable reminders ride the timer plane.
Supervision is restart-intensity escalation: more than `maxRestarts` (default 3) within
`restartWindow` (default 60s) escalates; the instance stops restarting, status records
`escalated`, the lifecycle retires terminally (§13.1), and the failure is loud. The restart
history is DURABLE on the instance's own status record, SUPERVISOR-OWNED (the status writer
carries it forward through every ordinary instance-side write, so a successor's `ready`
convergence can neither reset nor forge it), and each note is a revision-pinned CAS: a
supervisor restart cannot amnesty the count and two concurrent notes cannot merge-lose a
restart. Each history entry is bound to the DYING PROCESS EPOCH (a real restart advances the
epoch), so a replayed or duplicated notification of one restart is an idempotent no-op, never
a double count; and a supervision clock behind the newest recorded restart REFUSES rather
than silently truncating history. `escalated` is IRREVERSIBLE at the status writer (no later
write, any epoch, replaces it), refuses further notes, and is excluded from every liveness
derivation (a frozen scatter expected set never contains an escalated instance). The
escalation commits before the lifecycle retirement runs; the retire seam MUST be idempotent,
a retirement failure leaves the escalation standing, and a reconciler retries retirement on
already-escalated rows until it completes, recording completion durably (nothing
un-escalates).

**Interactive session**, a one-use, holder-bound, bidirectional byte stream to a managed target
(the `attach` reference case). Establishment is a two-step, collapsible exchange: the serving endpoint
mints a signed **session grant** bound to `(holder triple, target (owner, actor, lifecycleUid),
serving instanceId + epoch, expiry)` and returns it as the establishment answer, **never a transport
URL and never logged**; the holder **redeems** it by opening the session, which consumes it (create-only
CAS on the durable `session.<sessionId>` ledger row, §13.12; a second redeem is `conflict`). The grant
is non-bearer: redemption is **presenter-equality** bound to `holder` (§13.10), so a leaked grant confers
nothing. Authorization is the target command's own (`owner`/`any` + name authority, §13.9); a session is
never a path around the despawn/attach authorization.

The byte stream rides two CORE-ONLY rails, `eps.<endpoint>.<sessionId>.<epoch>.<in|out>` (§13.9), never
stream-captured: the holder publishes `in` and subscribes `out`, the serving endpoint the reverse; the
holder's grant covers exactly its own session's two subjects. **Framing** (the terminal-session profile):
application bytes are `{ k: "data", b: <standard base64> }`; control is structured JSON, `{ k: "ready" }`,
`{ k: "resize", cols, rows }` (both positive integers), `{ k: "end", reason }`, `{ k: "drop", bytes }`.
Ordering is per direction by publisher sequence. Flow is a bounded in-flight window per direction; output
the window cannot take is **dropped, counted, and surfaced** as a `drop` frame before the resumed stream,
never silently lost. On the holder's `ready` the serving side replays a byte-exact reconstruction of the
target's current screen, then streams live output in order. A degenerate or unparseable caller frame is
dropped, never a session teardown.

**Termination is honest and distinct**: every teardown surfaces an `end` frame naming a bounded reason,
`process-exit` (the target exited), `closed` (a party closed), `expired` (the session TTL elapsed),
`target-despawn` (the target lifecycle retired), `manager-restart` (the serving incarnation advanced its
epoch). The session binds the target's `(principal, lifecycleUid)` and the serving epoch (§13.1): a
successor incarnation (advanced epoch) refuses old-epoch grants, and a same-name successor is a distinct
session.

### 13.7 Contracts and discovery

**Clusters.** An endpoint's surface is a set of composable **capability clusters**, each
`{ urn, revision, attributes[], commands[], events[] }`:

- `urn`, reverse-DNS cluster type URN (`ai.cotal.lifecycle`, `com.acme.deploy`).
- `attributes`, readable/watchable state; each declares a name, value schema, and record
  derivation (which record key carries it). Attribute reads/subscribes ride the record
  contract, never ephemeral replies.
- `commands`, each declares name, input/output schemas, `class`, `targeted` (and if so which
  authz modes it admits), its **capability requirement** (the named capability minting maps to
  subjects, §13.9), its `effect` (below), and optional traits.
  Each `journal`-class command **MUST** declare **`admissionCeiling`** =
  `{ maxBytes, maxDepth, maxItems }`, the bounds its canonicalizer refuses beyond (§13.4
  item 3). The ceiling is **declared, never compiled in**, because it decides what a
  submission durably *becomes*: two implementations that agree on the wire and disagree on a
  constant would write different permanent decisions for identical bytes.
- `events`, name + payload schema; events ride the journal contract on the event plane
  (`epe….ev.<cluster>.<event>`), read-contained by event-topic grants.

**Effect.** A command declaration carries `effect`, one of `read` or `write`.

**Reachability.** `effect` is reachable only under `protocol.v: 2` (*Version*, below). A responder
whose descriptor is pinned to `v: 1` cannot declare the field on the command surface a caller
resolves against, and nothing in such a deployment consumes it, so the `v: 1` rule below is the
whole of what governs.

Note what the pin does NOT do. A descriptor MAY inline the registered cluster artifact verbatim
(*Descriptor and describe*, §13.7), and an artifact is not filtered against the parsed command
surface, so a key named `effect` inside one can appear on the wire under a `v: 1` descriptor. Its
presence there is not a declaration and MUST NOT be read as one. Repeat-safety information exists
only at `protocol.v: 2`, and a caller that recovers it from raw artifact bytes under a `v: 1`
descriptor has reinstated exactly the retry this section exists to stop, while believing it read a
declaration. A reference implementation that has not moved to
`2` therefore carries its repeat-safety knowledge somewhere off the wire, as a static allowlist of
the commands it knows to be safe to repeat. Such an allowlist stands in for this field for exactly
as long as no `v: 2` descriptor can exist, and it is superseded by the declaration the moment one
can: allowlist-says-safe and author-declares-`write` are answers to the same question, and two
answers to one question is one answer too many.

`read` asserts that executing the command again **changes nothing the command is trying to
change**: the state after two executions is the state after one, and any difference between their
results is only the freshness a caller would see by asking twice. The state in question is not
only the endpoint's own — a command whose intended effect lands somewhere else is still a `write`.
`evictPrincipal` on the delivery endpoint is the case that fixes the boundary: it drops live
broker connections and leaves the endpoint's own records untouched, and it is a `write`, because
dropping those connections is the point of calling it.

Exactly one class of difference is excluded, and it is narrow: the incidental trace of having been
called. Request ids, spans, access logs, metrics, counters, and timing are observable and are not
what the command was for, so a command is not `write` merely because it can be seen to have been
called. The test is not "did anything change" — something always does — but **would a caller who
repeated this command be surprised by what the repeat did**. If the answer is no, it is `read`.

`write` asserts nothing and MUST be assumed unsafe to repeat.

A client MUST NOT automatically re-issue a command declared `write` after any outcome that does
not prove non-execution (§13.3), **whatever `id` the re-issue carries**. The exemption is not the
token but the CONVERGENCE: a re-issue is a resubmission, governed by §13.8 rather than by this
rule, only while the responder will converge it onto the recorded prior decision. A re-issue the
responder accepts as NEW WORK is a repeat, and this prohibition binds it however the `id` was
chosen.

That distinction is load-bearing because the two are not distinguishable by inspection. Same-`id`
convergence lasts only while the prior decision is retained (§13.8), and a caller cannot observe
retention from outside — so a client that reuses an `id` after the horizon has issued a repeat
while believing it issued a resubmission. Reusing the token is therefore not a substitute for the
proof this rule demands: absent an outcome that proves non-execution, a client that cannot
establish convergence MUST treat its re-issue as a repeat and MUST NOT make it automatically.

`effect` is a property of the command, not of its delivery class: `class` says how a request is
carried, `effect` says whether carrying it twice is safe, and the two are independent — an
`ephemeral` command may be either.

`effect` is declarative, and a declaration is a claim the endpoint author makes. It binds
clients, not the responder: nothing in this section relieves a handler of its own correctness,
and a `read` declaration over a mutating handler is a defect in the endpoint, not a licence.

**Version.** `effect` cannot be introduced additively. A client that does not implement it
ignores it and retries exactly as it did before, and no default value repairs that direction,
because the field's entire purpose is to STOP a retry an older client already performs. So it
rides the discovery protocol's version marker rather than the unknown-field rule (§7).

That marker is the one that already exists: `protocol.v` on the **service record spec and the
describe descriptor** (*Descriptor and describe*, below). It is deliberately not a new field on
the cluster document, which has no `protocol` of its own — adding one there would be subject to §7
and dropped unread by exactly the clients this cut has to stop, which is the failure it is meant
to prevent. An instance whose registered clusters declare `effect` MUST register and describe with
`protocol.v` of `2`, and every command in every cluster it serves MUST then carry `effect`. `v:1`
descriptors remain valid, carry no `effect`, and give a resolving caller no repeat-safety
information — it MUST treat every command served under one as `write`. There is therefore no
"omitted `effect`" case under a `v:2` descriptor, and no surface in which the field is present but
optional.

A client that does not implement this section MUST refuse to resolve a descriptor whose
`protocol.v` it does not implement, rather than ignore what it cannot honor. **That refusal is a
requirement this section CREATES, not one already met.** What protects an unamended client today
is a fence on the other side of the wire: `describe`'s pinned output schema fixes
`descriptor.protocol.v` to the constant `1`, so an unamended responder cannot publish a `v:2`
descriptor at all — its own reply fails output validation and surfaces as a responder bug. The
registry read path fails closed the same way, refusing a service record whose `protocol.v` is not
`1`. The resolving caller does neither: it reads the describe answer without validating it, and
the shape it reads does not carry `protocol`. So the version marker is enforced today by the
RESPONDER's contract and by the REGISTRY reader, and by nothing in the caller — which is safe only
for as long as no `v:2` descriptor can exist.

**Emission.** Moving to `protocol.v: 2` **is** a non-additive discovery change, so §11's
change-process rule for one governs it and is the authority on how it is rolled out; this section
adds only what is specific to `2` and states no cutover rule of its own.

Specific to `2`: a caller that resolves a descriptor whose `protocol.v` it does not implement MUST
fail the resolve (`unsupported-version`) and MUST NOT invoke against it — a descriptor it cannot
read is not a weaker descriptor, it is no descriptor, and treating it as `v:1` reinstates exactly
the repeat this section exists to stop. Implementing that refusal is what makes a caller count as
having adopted this section for the purposes of §11's rule, which is the condition a responder's
deployment must satisfy before any responder in it registers or describes at `2`.

Why the rule lives there and not here: the condition is a property of the whole deployment, and a
responder cannot evaluate it from where it stands — per §11 there is no in-band capability
negotiation and no request carries a caller version, so a responder cannot tell an amended caller
from an unamended one. A rule stated here would bind the one party unable to check it. §11 assigns
it instead to the deployment, which can.

An **endpoint type** is a conformance set of cluster URNs. `manager` and `delivery` are
ordinary conformance sets defined by the reference implementation; core knows only
"endpoint".

**Schemas.** Contract schemas are JSON Schema **2020-12**, validated by a real 2020-12
validator (the reference implementation pins `ajv`), under this normative resource profile: a
schema is a **closed resource bundle**, either fully self-contained (local `$defs`/`#/…`
refs) or referencing other contract-store artifacts **by digest** only. `$id`/`$anchor`/
`$dynamicRef` resolve deterministically within the bundle; ambient HTTP/file/URI resolution
MUST NOT occur. Contract identity is the **closure digest** (above): the digest of the
manifest naming the complete resolved closure, not of the root document alone. Registration-time bounds (loud `contract-invalid`, distinct from
invocation-time `bad-request`): document ≤ 256 KiB, closure ≤ 1 MiB, nesting ≤ 32, ref chain
≤ 32, bounded pattern complexity, compile/validation time budgets, and a bounded compiled-schema cache (reference: 256-entry LRU) (§13.8). Runtime
validation at the serving boundary is mandatory: args before any effect, replies against the
output schema. Authoring tooling is free (the reference implementation authors in Zod); the
wire artifact and validation semantics are the JSON Schema documents themselves.
**Every command declares BOTH an input and an output schema**: a side with no payload
declares the **canonical void schema**, the artifact `{"type":"null"}`, whose RFC 8785
digest is therefore one fixed value, so both `op` digests exist for every command (§13.3)
and no shape in this section is conditional on a missing side. Validation against the void
schema means the side's payload is absent or `null`.

**Content addressing.** A contract artifact (cluster document, schema bundle member, trait
definition or attachment) is identified by the SHA-256 digest of its RFC 8785 canonical JSON
(strict RFC 8785 over I-JSON; the reference implementation pins `json-canonicalize`'s strict
path and gates on the RFC's published test vectors, including number-serialization and
surrogate edges). **Two digests, never conflated.** An **artifact digest** identifies ONE
document's bytes and is the value that keys its subject and every by-digest reference. A
**closure digest** identifies a whole resolved bundle, a cluster document or a schema
closure, and is the artifact digest of that bundle's **manifest**: the artifact
`{ v: 1, root: <artifact digest>, members: [<artifact digest>, …] }`, `members` being every
artifact transitively reachable through by-digest references from `root`, sorted
lexicographically and deduplicated. The manifest is itself an ordinary artifact on its own
digest subject, so a closure digest is an artifact digest, nothing dispatches on which kind
a digest is. Contract identity (§13.7 `contractDigest`, `clusterDigests[]`, and the
`op.inputDigest`/`outputDigest` a caller pins) is always a CLOSURE digest; a `$ref`-by-digest
inside a schema is always an ARTIFACT digest.

**Every `*Digest` field in this section is one scalar shape**, `sha256:<hex>`, lowercase
hex, and each names exactly one input, so no field's digest is implementation-defined:
`inputDigest`/`outputDigest`, `contractDigest`, `clusterDigests[]` = the CLOSURE digest of
the named bundle (above); a schema's by-digest `$ref` = an ARTIFACT digest;
`argsDigest`/`outcomeDigest`/`resultDigest` = over the strict RFC 8785 canonical JSON of
that value (absent iff the value is absent); `authDigest` = over the raw UTF-8 bytes of the
`auth` slot as carried (§13.3); `submissionDigest` = over the raw stored submission bytes
(§13.4). Integer fields on the wire (`sourceSeq`, `revision`, `epoch`, `ts`,
`deadlineMs`, `readinessDeadlineMs`) are non-negative integers ≤ 2^53 − 1, the I-JSON
interoperable range, so at most 16 decimal digits, which is what makes the §13.12
maximum-fact fixture a computable worst case rather than an estimate.

Artifacts live in the per-space **contract stream**: one artifact per
digest-keyed subject `cotal.<space>.epc.<digest-hex>` (§13.2), published as a single
message; possible because a document is bounded at 256 KiB (below) and the operator floor
asserts `max_payload` covers it (§13.12); a closure is fetched artifact-by-artifact through
its digest references, never as one blob. Reads are the subject-scoped last-by-subject
Direct Get on the exact digest subject, no consumer, no replay machinery, and nothing
body-selected (§13.9). Readers MUST verify fetched bytes against the digest and fail loud
on mismatch. Publication is mediated and create-only (§13.9): artifacts are immutable once
published. A single-message digest subject is readable subject-confined; a chunked object
store is not, because chunk replay needs a consumer whose delivery target is body-selected
(§13.9).

**Record kinds and key grammar.** Every record kind is registered: core kinds are defined
by this section (writer table, §13.9), and each kind's registry entry pins its **key
grammar** (the qualifier tokens between the kind token and the `.spec`/`.status` suffix),
its writer roles, and its mediation class; grants and merged watches are derived from that
grammar, so two implementations always agree on which key carries what. The core kinds'
key grammars, pinned here (each key then splits `.spec`/`.status` per §13.4, EXCEPT the
unsplit atomic keys the table marks: the `lifecycle` head, `govern`, `uid`, `oblig`,
`goalidx`, `goaleff`, `epname`, `epmig`, and `answer`):

| Kind | Key grammar |
| --- | --- |
| `svc` | `svc.<endpoint>.<instanceId>` |
| `signer` | `signer.<keyId>` |
| `handle` | `handle.<issuerKeyId>.<id>` |
| `contracts` | `contracts.<endpoint>` |
| `goal` | `goal.<endpoint>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<goalId>` |
| `goalidx` | `goalidx.<endpoint>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<goalId>` (atomic; an in-flight action's reconcile index, written create-only before the goal binds and deleted at its terminal, enumerated by the provisioner sweep so a superseded executor's orphaned goals settle; never caller-addressed). Writer: the **goal-writer** principal (§13.9), which composes the commit principal with three additions, this index subtree among them, and NOT the bare commit principal, whose enumeration does not reach this kind. The two are separated because the index is created BEFORE the bind, so the principal that writes it is the one that also binds; a deployment that grants the index on the bare commit row has widened every commit principal to reach a key only the goal writer needs |
| `goaleff` | `goaleff.<endpoint>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<goalId>.<gen>` (atomic; the at-most-one-launch election for one accepted action, written create-only by the effects executor that wins it and advanced by revision-CAS through its phases). `<gen>` is the accepted submission's **EPJ `sourceSeq`**, the sequence it was delivered at, carried verbatim into the acceptance fact; the only discriminator that exists at the EARLIEST coordinate, since `goalidx` is created before the bind and therefore before any decision fact exists, so a decision sequence cannot key it. The generation token is what keeps this kind out of the one-use-forever trap: a lawful later acceptance under the same `goalId` gets a different `<gen>` and a fresh key, never a permanent tombstone. Writer: the owning endpoint's **commit path** ONLY (§13.9), inherited by the goal-writer principal that composes it; the generic per-kind spec/status writer row does not reach it, because this kind is unsplit and has no `.spec`/`.status` to write. The value machine, including which actor may settle a row, is *The two coordination machines* below |
| `epname` | `epname.<endpoint>.<nameToken>` (atomic; the durable claim on one name, keyed by the NAME rather than by a caller triple, because the thing being made exclusive is the name and two callers must contend on one key). Writer: the owning endpoint's **commit path** ONLY (§13.9); unsplit, so create-only for the claim and revision-CAS for every state change. The state machine, its actor roles, and the claimant union are *The two coordination machines* below |
| `epmig` | `epmig.<endpoint>` (atomic; the endpoint's cutover manifest: the inventory a migration is performed against, and the durable record of the cutover runs performed against it, so a run generation is never reused by a later run). That run generation is **scoped to cutover and is key material nowhere else**: the `<gen>` token in the `goaleff` grammar is the accepted submission's EPJ `sourceSeq` and only that, the `goal`, `goalidx`, and `goal….result` grammars carry no generation token at all, and an implementation that keys any of them from this manifest has built an election two conforming peers can never meet inside. Writer: the owning endpoint's **commit path** ONLY (§13.9); unsplit, and its qualifier profile is `[qEndpoint]` alone, one manifest per endpoint, never one per caller or per run |
| `cp` | `cp.<endpoint>.<token>` |
| `lease` | `lease.<endpoint>.<pool>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>` (the item's acceptance identity, §13.2) |
| `lifecycle` | `lifecycle.<owner>.<actor>.<lifecycleUid>` (the §13.1 mapping detail) |
| `lifecycle` head | `lifecycle.<owner>.<actor>`; the alias's **authoritative current mapping**, and the ONLY key `mappingRevision` (§13.3) counts: a **single unsplit key** (NOT `.spec`/`.status`-split; the mapping is one atomic record, and a handler's "fresh current mapping" read is one leader-consistent read of this key returning `{ mapping, revision }`, the revision being the STORE revision, never a value field), CAS-updated, NEVER-DELETED (the head discipline: no grant permits DEL/PURGE, true absence alone is virgin, a deletion marker refuses loudly as corruption). States `active | retiring | retired` (§13.1): the mapping is current ONLY at `active`; `retiring` is the op-bound containment phase, non-current and not replaceable; `retired` asserts the completed §13.1 barrier. Activation CASes it from none (create-only) or from a `retired` predecessor to a freshly reserved UID's mapping; two concurrent mints for one alias cannot both win the CAS; the terminal barrier CASes `active → retiring` at its bar and `retiring → retired` as its final head step. The per-UID `lifecycle.<owner>.<actor>.<lifecycleUid>` detail below is optional append-only audit, never the authority |
| `uid` | `uid.<lifecycleUid>`; the §13.1 **space-global UID reservation**: a **single unsplit key**, create-only, NEVER-DELETED, value = `{ owner, actor, mintedBy }` (the reserving authority and intended alias, audit only; the KEY is the reservation). A key exists for every UID ever reserved, including burned candidates; a DEL/PURGE marker is corruption |
| `policy` | `policy.<endpoint>.<digest-hex>`; the §13.6 **immutable admission-policy version**: a **single unsplit key** per policy version, create-only, NEVER-DELETED. `<digest-hex>` is the SHA-256 hex (64 chars) of the record's canonical value bytes, so the key is SELF-CERTIFYING: a reader re-digests the value it read and refuses a mismatch. Immutability is a TRUSTED-WRITER invariant (create-only CAS by the sole writer) BACKED by that read-time self-certification, not a broker subtraction (KV create/update/delete share the one subject, §13.9): a different-byte overwrite is refused on read, and the residual (a DEL or same-byte overwrite by a buggy/compromised writer destroying availability under history 1) fails admission closed rather than admitting a lost policy. `enforcedPolicyKey`/`pendingPolicyKey` on the govern head (§13.6) name keys of exactly this kind, which is what keeps BOTH the enforced and the pending policy readable through a mutation's whole drain window. Writer: the provisioner registration path ONLY (§13.9); a DEL/PURGE marker is corruption |
| `oblig` | `oblig.<targetUid>.<endpoint>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>`; the §13.8 **target-indexed acceptance obligation**: a **single unsplit key** whose grammar IS the deterministic acceptance identity (target lifecycle UID first, so a retirement barrier enumerates `oblig.<targetUid>.>`), create-only winner, monotonic value states, NEVER-DELETED. An admission under policy with NO target lifecycle keys the row with the fixed sentinel target token `ep` (which the §13.1 UID token grammar can never produce, so no collision exists): `oblig.ep.<endpoint>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>`: excluded from retirement drains (it binds no lifecycle) and included, like every targeted row, in the endpoint's policy drain via the endpoint-position filter `oblig.*.<endpoint>.>` (§13.6/§13.8) |
| `frontier` | `frontier.<lifecycleUid>`; the §13.1 **per-stream retirement frontiers**: a **single unsplit key** per retired lifecycle, create-only, NEVER-DELETED, value = `{ lifecycleUid, opId, streams }` where `streams` maps each lifecycle-bounded stream to its last sequence at retirement. Written by the terminal barrier AFTER the obligation drain, the drain's repair-principal fence, the pool cleaner, and the cleaner-credential revoke+evict, and BEFORE the gate/head terminals (§13.1 order), so a `retired` head implies its frontier exists. The cutoffs bound the predecessor's half-open interval `(activationFrontier, retirementFrontier]` (§8); they are never a successor's start (a successor captures its OWN activation frontier). Writer: the minting authority's retirement barrier ONLY; it records once, under its own operation (a foreign-op record refuses the barrier closed); a DEL/PURGE marker is corruption |
| `govern` | `govern.<endpoint>`; the endpoint's **governance head**: a **single unsplit key** (NOT `.spec`/`.status`-split), value = the endpoint's MONOTONIC binding map, command to governed URN set, the NORMATIVE **admission-policy selector** `{ enforcedPolicyKey, enforcedPolicyRevision, pendingPolicyKey?, pendingPolicyRevision? }` (§13.6: `enforcedPolicyKey` is the exact records key of the immutable `policy` record currently governing admission and `enforcedPolicyRevision` its store revision, so any implementer selects the endpoint-wide enforced policy WITHOUT per-instance guesswork; a mutation stages `pendingPolicy…` and promotes it into `enforcedPolicy…` only after the endpoint's obligation drain, so the selector alone decides which revision governs during the drain window), plus whatever internal serialization state the provisioner's registration CAS needs (that state is non-normative: a second implementer may linearize registration with a different slot shape and conform, provided every registration contends on this head under its frozen gate through spec publication, the policy selector fields carry the meaning above, and the external guarantees hold). Enforcing the governed-attachment no-strip/no-downgrade mandate (Traits, below) is a HISTORY-bearing, ENDPOINT-WIDE property: a fresh instance, a remove-then-re-add, or a concurrent registration must not launder a governed binding away, so this head is also the endpoint's **registration linearization point**. Writer: the provisioner registration path ONLY (§13.9); NEVER-DELETED, per the `lifecycle`-head discipline |

| `run` | `run.<endpoint>.<runId>`; a **workflow run's** last-value-wins state beside its append-only step journal (§14). `.spec`/`.status`-split, and the split is load-bearing: the spec is what the run IS, decided once at start and never rewritten (`{ v: 1, run, pins, createdAt }`, the resolved PIN SET of §14.3), the status is what it is DOING (`{ v: 1, observedSpecRevision, state, holder, epoch, fencingToken, journalHigh, at }`), so a lease renewal can never rewrite the pins. `<runId>` is an id token minted by the DRIVER, never caller-supplied and **never reused**: a run is never re-run under its own id (that is a fork, and a fork takes a new id), so a deleted `run` key staying closed is correct and no generation token is owed. A fork's child is a new run under a new id and this revision records no lineage on it (§14.3); a later revision that adds a parent field puts it on the SPEC half and never the status half, because parentage is decided at creation and a status-half lineage could name a different parent after a takeover. Writer: the run driver's commit path ONLY (§13.9) |
| `answer` | `answer.<endpoint>.<token>.<answerId>`; a checkpoint's ANSWER payload beside its one-use settle fact (§13.6, `answerId`/`settledAnswerId`): a **single unsplit key**, create-only, never updated and never deleted, value `{ v: 1, token, answerId, value?, artifact?, by, at }`. **Keyed per answer rather than per presenter because a workflow checkpoint's holder is the run driver and every resolver reaches the checkpoint through it, so every presenter is the same principal**: a presenter-keyed slot collapses to one, two racing resolvers overwrite it, and the settlement then selects whichever answer was written last rather than the one that won. `<answerId>` is derived from the answer's own content (§14.5), so a retry after a crash lands on its own record with its own bytes. Writer: the run driver's commit path ONLY (§13.9) |
| `notice` | `notice.<endpoint>.<runId>.<addresseeId>.<noticeId>`; one bounded decision a workflow told one agent (`notify`, [`spec/cotal-lang.md`](spec/cotal-lang.md) §6.8), filed onto the run and rendered ahead of that agent's next turn, never a channel message. `.spec`/`.status`-split: the spec is the notice (`{ v: 1, run, step, addressee, fact, at }`) and is create-only, the status is its consumption (`{ v: 1, consumedAt, by, observedSpecRevision }`). **`<addresseeId>` is a digest of the agent's name and never the name, because an agent name is dotted and a dot is the key separator**: a raw name re-tokenizes the key into a key of another shape, and mangling it destroys the identity being keyed on; a reader holding the handle re-derives the same token (§14.5), so per-addressee enumeration stays one prefix scan. `<noticeId>` is derived from the step's request id and the addressee, so a `notify` re-run after a crash lands on the same records. Writer: the run driver's commit path ONLY (§13.9) |
| `migration` | `migration.<endpoint>.<runId>.<migrationId>`; one run's move onto edited source ([`spec/cotal-lang.md`](spec/cotal-lang.md) §11.2): what the divergence-and-orphan check found, which refusals a person overrode, and who they were. `.spec`/`.status`-split: the spec is the REPORT (`{ v: 1, run, fromHash?, toHash, at, consumedThrough, orphans[], overrides[], actor }`) and is create-only, the status is the APPLICATION (`{ v: 1, appliedAt, by, observedSpecRevision }`) and names the driver that advanced the run. Its own kind because it is neither half of the run record: a migration is append-only history with an actor on it, and a run can migrate more than once, so the status half would let the second erase the first and the spec half cannot be written twice. **`<migrationId>` is a digest of the report's own content and never a counter**, because a migration is decided by a dry walk a crash can force to be re-run, so the same decision must land on the same record rather than filing a second one, and a counter would need a second arbiter for a fact the content already determines (§14.5). **The application is create-only for the same reason the notice's consumption is**: two drivers racing to advance one run both find no status and both write, and the store decides which one moved it. Writer: the run driver's commit path ONLY (§13.9) |

Third-party kinds
register under reverse-DNS kind names.

**The two coordination machines.** `goaleff` and `epname` carry closed value machines. A row's
legal field set is fixed per phase or per state, and a writer that presents a field the phase does
not define, or omits one it does, is refused rather than accommodated: a single broad object with
everything optional cannot express that a field is present exactly when a launch is in flight, and
present-exactly-when is the only form in which those fields decide anything.

`goaleff` has four phases: `claimed`, `launching`, `launched`, `settled`. Every row carries `v: 1`,
the electing `executor` as an incarnation `{ instanceId, processEpoch }`, the `attemptId` nonce of
the attempt that won the election, and `ts`. `launching` and `launched` additionally carry `addr`,
the allocated address `{ nameToken, lifecycleUid }`; `settled` MAY carry it; `claimed` MUST NOT.
The legal edges are `claimed → launching`, `claimed → settled`, `launching → launched`,
`launching → settled`, and `launched → settled`. `settled` is terminal because no edge leaves it,
which is the terminality rule itself rather than a separate check that could come to disagree with
the table. The `executor` and `attemptId` do not move across an edge, and an allocated `addr` is
never rewritten to a different one.

Two actor roles take those edges. An **executor** may take any of them and MUST be the row's own
executor at the row's own `attemptId`: a re-read that finds a foreign incarnation or a foreign
nonce is a loss, never a licence to proceed. A **sweeper** acts for an executor it believes is gone
and MAY take only the edges into `settled`, because advancing a launch phase on a dead executor's
behalf is the split brain the election exists to prevent, and the resulting row is
indistinguishable from the executor having advanced it. An actor presenting neither role is
refused; an unrecognized role that falls through both checks is the most permissive possible answer
to the question of who is acting.

Every settle is gated on the goal's terminal fact **already existing**. Settling without one
publishes a row asserting that a goal finished when nothing durable records that it did, so the
terminal-first order is normative and the reverse order is never legal. A crash between the two is
a row left un-settled with its terminal present, which is recoverable; the reverse would not be.

`epname` has seven states: `claimed`, `launching`, `live`, `preserved`, `relaunching`, `draining`,
`released`. Every row carries `v: 1`, `ts`, `state`, and `claimant`, which is either `null` or one
of three kinds: an **action** claim `{ goalId, gen }`, a **direct** claim
`{ instanceId, processEpoch, opId }`, or an **incumbent** claim `{ backfillId }` recorded by a
cutover backfill. A launch in flight (`launching`, `relaunching`) additionally carries
`lifecycleUid`, `launchAttemptId`, and the `executor` incarnation; a name that is up (`live`,
`preserved`) carries `lifecycleUid` and `runtimeOwner`; `draining` carries `lifecycleUid`,
`runtimeOwner`, and `enteredAt`; `claimed` and `released` carry the base fields alone.

`runtimeOwner` is the incarnation that owns the handle table for the name, and it is **moved, never
derived**. It MOVES on the four launch-resolving edges, `launching → live`, `relaunching → live`,
`launching → draining`, and `relaunching → draining`: the row's full `executor` incarnation becomes
its `runtimeOwner` and `launchAttemptId` is cleared, recorded at the moment it becomes true. Both
fields of the incarnation move together, because an `instanceId` without its `processEpoch` names a
process rather than the run of it that holds the handle table. On the three edges that neither
create the row nor resolve a launch, `live → preserved`, `live → draining`, and
`preserved → draining`, it is CARRIED unchanged. The one creation edge that produces a `live` row,
the cutover backfill, INSTALLS it instead, read from the incumbent's own live gate row: a cutover
that cannot read one MUST record a casualty rather than backfill, because a `live` row whose owner
is unknown puts an unevaluable value into the durable record that every later release reads. Except
on that edge it is never reconstructed from any other row, because a supported deployment mode has no such row to read and a
predicate that cannot be evaluated on a supported path either refuses forever or falls back to
absence. An `instanceId` alone will not stand in: an identity is not an incarnation, and a
restarted process under the same identity holds an empty handle table, which is the absence of
knowledge rather than knowledge of absence.

Six actor roles take the `epname` edges. An **allocator** creates a claim (`→ claimed`, and
`released → claimed`, so a released name is claimable again and the row is never deleted). A
**claimant** drives its own launch (`claimed → launching → live`) and may abandon an unlaunched
claim (`claimed → released`). A **holder**, identified by the row's `lifecycleUid`, drives the
preserve cycle (`live → preserved → relaunching → live`). A **sweeper** may release an unlaunched
claim and may move `launching`, `live`, `preserved`, or `relaunching` into `draining`. A
**cutover** may establish a `live` incumbent directly, which is the backfill path. An **operator**
has exactly one edge, `draining → released`.

That last edge is operator-only by design rather than by omission. An ordinary release would
require an actor attesting that a runtime is gone, and no such actor can exist: an owner still
alive has no per-attempt handle to attest about, and a restarted one is a different incarnation.
The edge is therefore removed rather than weakened, and `draining` is a state an operator clears by
hand until a durable runtime-attempt token exists. Two consequences follow and are normative. A
goal reaching a `succeeded` terminal does **not** release the name it holds; and release is a
transition to `released`, never a delete, so the row survives to answer who held the name last.

**The actor roles above are entitlements inside the value machines, not wire principals, and which
principal may present each of them is unspecified: RAISED, NOT SETTLED.** The write grants on both
kinds are the commit path and the goal-writer principal that composes it (§13.9). No sweeper,
operator, allocator, or cutover principal is granted anywhere in this document, so this section
does not say whether a conforming sweep runs under the commit principal or under a principal a
deployment would have to add. An implementation MUST NOT read a role in these machines as
conferring a grant, and a deployment that needs a distinct sweep identity is outside what this
version specifies.

**Descriptor and describe.** Each instance registers a **service record** (kind `svc`, key
`svc.<endpoint>.<instanceId>`; the owner is determined by the name and recorded in the
value): spec = `{ endpoint, owner, endpointType?,
clusterDigests[], protocol: { v: 1 | 2 }, activation? }`, status = `{ epoch, state,
observedSpecRevision, … }` (writer table §13.9). The spec key's **store revision is the
instance's `registrationRevision`**, the value scatter freezes (§13.5): it advances only
when the mediated registration path writes the spec key, so an advance during a scatter is
exactly a re-registration. `describe` is a reserved untargeted
ephemeral command every endpoint MUST serve, returning the descriptor with clusters inline or
by digest. **Authorization-scoped answers use a trusted authorization source only**: the
answer is intersected against a fresh view of the caller's authority obtained from the
deployment's authorization ledger/callout (§9/§10), keyed by the broker-authenticated caller
identity, never against payload- or slot-asserted scope, which is ignored. If the trusted
view is unavailable or stale beyond its declared freshness bound, describe fails closed
(`unavailable`) rather than answering from a weaker source; deployments MAY declare an
endpoint's descriptor public, in which case no view is consulted and the answer says so.
Descriptor visibility is never inferred from reachability of `describe` alone. A KV browse
index (record kind `contracts`) is an advisory convenience copy; `describe` is authoritative.

**Manager-service records.** A remote manager registration is one closed, opaque-instance family:
its `svc.manager.<instanceId>` spec/status pair, its instance-bound contract closure, and its
`epgate.manager.<instanceId>` / `epcred.manager.<instanceId>.<credentialId>` rows all name the
same server-authorized `{ owner, managerActor, lifecycleUid, instanceId }` tuple. The registration
mediator MUST reject any tuple mismatch, instance collision, contract substitution, or status/gate
operation from another principal or lifecycle. It may publish only the contract artifacts staged by
`prepare`; it may not use manager-service authority to publish a contract for any other endpoint.
Retiring the family retires the instance record and gate together; no stale stage, registration,
contract, status, or credential can activate a new lifecycle or another instance. `describe` and
status report the manager instance's serving/degraded state without treating discovery as
authorization (§13.9).

**Invocation binding.** The digests are not caller courtesy but a two-sided requirement
(§13.3): a caller MUST pin `op.inputDigest`/`op.outputDigest` on every command except
`describe` (the discovery bootstrap), and a serving member MUST reject their absence
(`contract-mismatch`) before any effect; an unpinned invocation cannot silently bypass the
describe→invoke binding, and MUST honor pinned digests or reject `contract-mismatch`. Rolling updates keep classes contract-homogeneous: an incompatible
generation registers a distinct routable identity (new endpoint name or explicit version
label) until homogeneous.

**Traits.** A trait attaches governed metadata to a cluster, command, attribute, or event.
A **trait definition** `{ urn, valueSchema (digest), selector, breakingChanges, authority }`
is content-addressed and signed: `ai.cotal.*` definitions by the space-operator authority;
third-party definitions by their defining owner's registered key. **Attachment authority is
distinct from definition authority**: every *required/governed* attachment (this revision governs
exactly `ai.cotal.guarded` and `ai.cotal.priced`) is separately signed by the definition's
named authority over `{ endpoint, command, contractDigest (the cluster document's complete
closure digest), traitUrn, value }`, so a self-published descriptor cannot strip, forge, or downgrade a governed
annotation; removal or downgrade is an authorized contract revision. Enforcement is
fail-closed at the pre-effect seam: missing, unverifiable, or stale governed attachments
refuse before effect. Non-governed traits are unsigned vocabulary.

**Compatibility.** Cluster evolution is BACKWARD by default: within a revision line, changes
MUST be additive and added fields MUST carry defaults; removal, rename, or semantic change
mints a new cluster URN version. A push-time JSON-native compatibility differ + review gate
enforce this in the reference workflow (repository tooling under `scripts/`, not shipped
client code). The discovery protocol itself is versioned under `protocol.v`, additively by
default: a bump is reserved for a change a client cannot safely ignore, and `effect` (§13.7) is
the one such change so far — a client that ignored it would keep performing exactly the retry the
field exists to stop, so it refuses the document instead.

### 13.8 Distributed guarantees

- **Idempotency scope.** Ephemeral idempotent commands by `id` (handler-local, within result
  retention); journaled submissions and actions by `id`/`goalId` + fingerprint within the
  declared horizon. Exactly-once is bounded honestly: delivery is at-least-once; Cotal
  guarantees idempotent submission/fact recording and fenced commits of Cotal-owned state; an
  external side effect is exactly-once only when the external API honors the propagated
  idempotency key or fencing token, else the contract documents at-least-once effects.
- **Repeat versus resubmission.** **A command that is idempotent by `id` is NOT thereby `read`:
  safe to resubmit is not safe to repeat.** That is the rule neither mechanism states alone, and
  declaring such a command `read` licenses a fresh-`id` retry that duplicates the effect. The two
  properties are independent; a command may hold either, both, or neither.

  A **resubmission** is a re-send the responder CONVERGES onto the decision it already recorded; a
  **repeat** is a re-send it accepts as new work. Reusing the `id` is how a caller ASKS for
  convergence, and within the horizon below it is how convergence is keyed — but the `id` is the
  request, not the answer, and a re-send under a reused token that the responder accepts as new
  work is a repeat by this definition. `effect` (§13.7) governs repeats, whatever token they
  carry. `id` governs resubmissions — and what `id` alone is worth differs by rail:
  - **Ephemeral** — `id` is the whole key. A same-`id` resubmission within result retention is
    the same call; an idempotent command may dedup on it and consult nothing else.
  - **Journal** — `id` is necessary but NOT sufficient. It is one of the fields the fingerprint
    binds, so a same-`id` resubmission converges to the first outcome only if the rest of the
    fingerprint matches too. Same `id` with different args is neither a resubmission nor a fresh
    call: it is a loud `conflict` (§13.4), because the decision subject is already occupied by a
    fact with a different fingerprint. A caller that mutates arguments and reuses an `id`
    therefore gets an error rather than either behaviour it might have expected from the
    ephemeral rail.

  **Both rails are bounded by a horizon, and outside it neither rule applies.** A resubmission is
  a resubmission only while the prior decision is still retained — the idempotency horizon is
  realized by decision-fact retention on the journal rail and by result retention on the ephemeral
  rail, never by a clock (§13.4). Once the retained decision is gone, the `id` carries no history:
  a re-send under it is a fresh call that WILL execute, and the same `id` with different args is
  no longer a `conflict` but simply a new submission. The finite horizon is what makes the decision
  store finite, so this is a fact callers MUST hold rather than a hole to be closed — but the hole
  it WOULD open if `repeat` were defined by the token is closed at the definition above: a re-send
  the responder accepts as new work is a **repeat**, so a post-horizon same-`id` re-send of a
  `write` is exactly what §13.7 prohibits a client from making automatically. Reusing the token
  buys nothing outside the horizon, and a caller that cannot establish it is still inside one has
  not established that its re-send is safe.

  Neither word is "retry": callers retry under a reused `id` and under a fresh one and mean the
  same English word both times, which is the confusion this paragraph exists to remove. And the
  dangerous reading is a REASONABLE one, not a careless one — an operator who has correctly
  learned that a command is idempotent by `id` will retry it after a timeout, mint a fresh `id`
  because the old request is gone, and get a second effect. Nothing in this document told them
  those were different acts until now.
- **Fencing and mediated commits.** Every Cotal-owned authoritative transition flows through
  its mediated writer (§13.9) carrying `(fencingToken | lifecycleUid | epoch)` as applicable;
  the writer validates token currency, unexpired lease against its own clock, lifecycle
  currency, and epoch currency. Value-carried tokens + CAS stop conforming-but-stale writers;
  scoped credentials + mediation stop everything else. The threat boundary of any
  direct-owner write is explicitly downgraded (§13.9).
- **CAS conflict.** Any lost CAS is a loud `conflict`; the loser re-reads and re-decides.
- **Authority-head reservation/drain.** An authority head (the §13.1 lifecycle head; the
  §13.6 registered admission policy) and a durable acceptance/start fact live in different
  streams; no cross-stream CAS exists, and a revision carried inside a fact is provenance,
  never a fence. Any durable acceptance or start that creates work bound to a lifecycle,
  or admits work under a policy read, therefore contends with the head's movement on ONE
  durable serialization coordinate: the **target-indexed obligation row** (kind `oblig`,
  §13.7). In order: (1) BEFORE the EPF decision publish, the writer obtains the obligation
  through the **admission mediator**. The mediator owns the `oblig.` prefix (the
  canonicalizer holds no raw write on it), derives the coordinate from the
  broker-authenticated request subject (never from a body field), and IMMEDIATELY before
  the create performs the FENCING currency reads it will pin: for a target-bound
  admission a leader-served read of the target's lifecycle head, REFUSING unless the state
  is `active` (a `retiring` or `retired` target admits nothing); for a policy-admitted
  decision a leader-served read of the governance head (§13.6) that FIRST refuses if a
  `pendingPolicyKey` is present (the endpoint is inside its drain window; the drain-window
  admission pause is a normative step of THIS algorithm, not only a §13.6 property, so any
  conforming mediator refuses without needing to infer it) and only then follows
  `enforcedPolicyKey`, self-certifies it (§13.7), and pins its `enforcedPolicyRevision` as
  `policyRevision`. Refusing at the create-fence (not only at the post-create recheck) is
  also what bounds the row set: a request that could not create its row leaves no
  never-deleted `oblig` debt behind, so a long or crashed drain cannot accumulate an
  unbounded set of rejected rows. An admission with no target lifecycle keys the
  row under the fixed sentinel target token `ep` (§13.7). It then creates the row
  create-only at the deterministic acceptance-identity
  key `oblig.<targetUid>.<endpoint>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>`. The KEY never contains
  `sourceSeq`, delivery attempt, mapping revision, or writer op id (a redelivery of the
  same logical acceptance MUST land on the SAME key); where a digest stands in for the
  tuple it is a versioned, collision-resistant digest of exactly that tuple, never
  delimiter-ambiguous concatenation. The VALUE pins the first winner under a CLOSED
  per-class schema: every row carries `{ state: provisional | accepted | rejected |
  terminal, decision: epf | self, opId }` plus the currency pins taken above
  (`mappingRevision` iff target-bound, `policyRevision` iff policy-admitted; at least one
  present); an `epf`-class row (a canonical acceptance) adds `{ fingerprint, sourceSeq,
  route }`; a `self`-class row (a guarded record commit, e.g. the restart-status CAS,
  §13.6) adds the COMPLETE commit intent `{ commitKey, commitBaseRevision, commitValue,
  commitDigest }`: the exact record key its accepted state authorizes, the store revision of
  that record the commit CASes FROM, the value it commits, and that value's digest.
  `commitValue` is a CLOSED discriminated union, so two implementations resolve and replay the
  SAME value: `{ enc: "b64u", bytes }` carries a JSON encoding of the committed value,
  base64url-encoded (RFC 4648 §5, no padding), or `{ enc: "ref", key }` names an
  IMMUTABLE, create-only records key (the §13.7 `policy` kind or another never-overwritten
  key) whose stored value IS the commit value; a mutable or absent `ref` target
  refuses at recovery, fail-closed. Never only a digest (a digest cannot reconstruct the
  value a crash recovery must re-write). `commitDigest` is the RFC-8785 CANONICAL content
  digest of the committed value, `sha256:<hex>` (the same `*Digest` scalar shape §13.7 uses
  everywhere; over the CANONICAL value, never a non-canonical storage stringify, so the
  landed/not-landed comparison is insensitive to how the store serializes the record). A
  crashed writer's commit is thus deterministically finishable from the row alone (below). The
  `decision` class is fixed by the TRUSTED operation kind, never caller-selectable. A
  create loser leader-reads the winner: the FULL pinned identity must match to join (an
  `epf`-class row on coordinate + fingerprint + route; a `self`-class row on the ENTIRE commit
  intent `commitKey` + `commitBaseRevision` + `commitDigest`, so two different desired values
  or base revisions never join under one `commitKey`); any
  mismatch is `conflict`, never a second obligation. (2) **Proof issuance is a post-create
  currency recheck, and admission is proof-gated**: after winning or joining the create,
  the mediator leader-reads the SAME coordinates AGAIN, and only if the target head is
  still `active` at the pinned `mappingRevision` AND (for a policy-admitted decision) the
  governance head STILL stages no `pendingPolicyKey` and the enforced policy is still at
  the pinned `policyRevision` does it return the opaque admission proof; otherwise it
  IMMEDIATELY settles its own provisional through the row's decision coordinate (below) and
  refuses. The recheck reads the SAME govern head the create-fence read, so a
  `pendingPolicy` staged in the window between the create and the recheck also fails
  proof issuance, not merely a moved `enforcedPolicyRevision`.
  No target-bound or policy-admitted EPF acceptance may publish, and no `self`-class
  guarded commit may run, without an unexpired proof issued under this rule. This is the
  structural half of the head fence: an obligation created in the window between a fresh
  `active` read and a head or policy movement exists durably, but its proof can never
  issue, so it can never admit; it is inert cleanup debt any later drain settles. (3) The
  EPF decision CAS runs as
  specified (§13.4), publishing with the WINNER's pinned acceptance identity and
  `sourceSeq`, whichever delivery is processing; a `self`-class writer instead advances
  its own row `provisional → accepted` (revision-pinned) and performs its guarded commit
  only while the row is `accepted`. (4) On acceptance the SAME key advances
  `provisional → accepted` and is retained until the accepted route is
  terminal and cleaned: the only enumerable record of accepted work is never
  erased at the moment it wins. States are monotonic (`provisional → accepted →
  terminal`, or `provisional → rejected`), the row is NEVER-DELETED, and a DEL/PURGE
  marker is corruption. The stored `opId` is not a bearer capability: a resuming writer
  re-authenticates as the same endpoint-scoped principal through the mediator and joins
  by acceptance identity + fingerprint; any opaque reservation token the mediator issues
  is target/endpoint/connection-bound, bounded-lived, and checked against the CURRENT
  obligation state; the durable obligation is the authority, never possession of its
  identifier. **The decision coordinate is per-class** and is where every unresolved row
  settles: an `epf`-class row settles through the EPF decision subject's create-only CAS
  (read the winner; if absent, create-only publish the terminal rejection so a delayed
  acceptance CAS loses; the mediator holds that rejection-publish authority and executes
  it for its own recheck refusals and on behalf of the drains, §13.9); a `self`-class row
  settles on ITSELF: while still `provisional`, the drain CASes `provisional → rejected`
  (the writer's `provisional → accepted` CAS and the drain's rejection contend on the ONE
  row, exactly one wins, and a delayed guarded commit finds its authority gone). An
  `accepted` `self`-class row is NOT stuck and does NOT block quiescence: because the row
  pins the complete commit intent `{ commitKey, commitBaseRevision, commitValue, commitDigest }`,
  either
  the writer's own resume OR a drain reconciler drives it `accepted → terminal`
  deterministically. Read the record at `commitKey`: if its value canonically digests to
  `commitDigest` the commit landed, CAS the row `accepted → terminal`; if it is still at
  `commitBaseRevision` the commit did not run, re-apply it by CASing the resolved
  `commitValue` (decode `b64u`, or leader-read the immutable `ref` key's value, verifying its
  canonical digest against `commitDigest` BEFORE writing) at
  `commitBaseRevision` then CAS the row terminal; if the
  record has moved PAST
  `commitBaseRevision` to a foreign value the intended commit can never land (the guarded
  CAS would lose), so CAS the row straight to `terminal` as superseded. Quiescence therefore
  means NO `provisional` and NO un-driven `accepted` `self`-class rows remain: an accepted
  commit is always completable from the row alone, never an unrecoverable orphan. **Reclamation is never
  clock-only**, and because the EPF writer need not be the retiring lifecycle (a
  cross-endpoint canonicalizer publishes decisions bound to a foreign target, and revoking
  the TARGET's credential family disarms nothing that writer holds), target-side
  revocation alone is NEVER the reclamation condition. An unresolved `provisional` is
  reclaimed only by: settling it through its decision coordinate; or revoking +
  verified-evicting the WRITER's own commit authority; or the target head being
  non-current AND the drain below having completed to quiescence under the create fence +
  proof gate. A timeout alone never frees a slot
  while the writer retains publish authority. **Drain to quiescence**: after the head
  CASes to `retiring` (§13.1), and equally when a policy mutation must enforce a new
  revision (§13.6, enumerating `oblig.*.<endpoint>.>`), the drain enumerates the prefix
  (`oblig.<targetUid>.>` for retirement), settles every
  unresolved row through its decision coordinate, completes accept-side reconciliation
  (enqueue/goal/terminal, §13.6) for accepted rows, then RE-ENUMERATES, and records its
  cleaner and frontier completion (or treats the new policy as enforced) only when an
  enumeration finds no unsettled row. A provisional whose pinned `mappingRevision` or
  `policyRevision` is no longer the live coordinate is settled as REJECTION, never treated
  as still open for acceptance. A row created after the final enumeration cannot admit
  (its proof can never issue, step 2) and is settled by any later enumeration;
  an acceptance published after the recorded cleanup frontier from a
  stale `active` read is non-conformant even if later effect resolution would reject it.
  Whether the obligation is released once the route is settled under ordinary policy
  movement (`release-after-accept`) or survives as cleanup debt the terminal barrier must
  observe (`promote-to-lifecycle-obligation`) is fixed by the TRUSTED operation kind,
  never caller-selectable. The admission-policy specialization additionally binds
  identity at the read: the confined policy reader's request subject pins the
  authenticated canonicalizer endpoint AND the requested policy endpoint, requires their
  equality, derives the reply rail from that authenticated subject, and returns
  `{ policy, revision }` with an opaque proof binding `{ space, endpoint, policy
  revision, obligation/op id }`; endpoint A can never obtain, or replay, endpoint B's
  admission proof.
- **Retry/backoff.** Only idempotent-at-scope operations are retried: exponential backoff,
  base 250 ms, factor 2, cap 15 s, full jitter, bounded by the caller deadline.
- **Deadlines.** Mandatory on call, scatter, claims, checkpoints, timers, sessions. Reference
  default call deadline 15 s; defaults are overridable, never removable.
- **Cancellation ordering.** First terminal fact at the mediated commit point wins.
- **Watch recovery.** Fell-behind ⇒ snapshot re-read then resume; bounded relist; no silent
  gap-skipping.
- **Ordering/partitioning.** Per-subject only; the subject is the partition key.
- **Retention floors.** Submissions ≥ recovery/redelivery lag (§13.12; native dedupe is not
  relied upon, §13.4); facts/tombstones ≥ idempotency horizon;
  results ≥ result retention; receipts ≥ receipt retention; timers ≥ max deadline + recovery
  margin. **Pool coupling:** every accepted pool item carries an **absolute work expiry**
  (`workExpiry`, set at acceptance in the AcceptanceFact, NOT a per-message age a
  reconciliation re-publish would reset; a re-enqueue re-publishes with the SAME `workExpiry`,
  and the item is dead once it passes, leased or not). The EPW stream's max age is ≥ the
  maximum `workExpiry` + recovery margin, and a pool item's decision and `wrk` terminal facts
  are retained ≥ that same bound, so a live (or crash-recovering) item can never outlive the
  facts that identify it as accepted or settled: a decision that expired under a still-live
  item would let a reused id collide with the old enqueue, and an expired `wrk` under a
  lost owner ack would make settled work unrecognizable on redelivery. A reused `id` becomes
  new work only after the old item's `workExpiry` AND its facts' retention have both passed.
  An endpoint MUST refuse to start against a store below its declared floors.
- **Backpressure and budgets.** Bounded consumer pending (default 1024), bounded
  virtual-endpoint pools and session windows, flow control on watches; overload is
  `resource-exhausted`. Schema compile/validate budgets (reference: 100 ms / 10 ms) and
  bounded regex; over budget is `contract-invalid`/`bad-request`.
- **Timers.** Broker message schedules at the 2.12 floor; same-subject replacement only (at
  the mediated `.armed` subject, §13.12); generation- and scheduler-origin-validated firing
  (stale or foreign-origin ⇒ no-op); durable reconciliation repairs
  status↔schedule divergence; replication and offline-assets downgrade fail loud at the
  broker floor gate.

### 13.9 Authority boundary

The credential is the coarse boundary; every subject in §13.2 is default-deny. Every
**statically expressible** authorization dimension is broker-enforced through the subject
grammar: caller identity + lifecycle, endpoint,
command, the target components each mode pins statically (§13.2: the full triple for `self`,
the caller's own, and for `handle`, redemption-pinned; the owner for
`owner`/`any`/`child`/`ledger`), serve identity, reply
**attribution**, and plane writer ownership.
Reply **addressing** is the one deliberate exception: it is capability-by-secret (the
per-request nonce, §13.2), not a broker grant, and it is sound precisely because serve
credentials cannot plain-subscribe the class rail (queue-qualified grants, §13.2), so nonces
are visible only to the instance the queue selected (plus every instance on a scatter, which
is scatter's definition). Target enforcement is stated per mode, never as a blanket claim:
`self` is broker-confined end to end including the lifecycle UID; `handle` is broker-confined
on the full redemption-pinned target triple, with the validator re-checking only mapping
currency; `owner`/`any` are broker-confined on the target owner and validator-primary on the
actor and UID currency; `child`/`ledger` are validator-primary within their distinct broker
rails. The **named dynamic relations** (static-mesh
own-child, fresh-ledger escalation, target-mapping currency, authorization epochs after
acceptance) are trusted-validator-primary by design, fail-closed, and operate only within
the broker ceiling. Handlers only narrow. **The process epoch fences only the five planes
whose subjects carry it** (reply, `epe`, `ept`, `eps`, `epr`). Request-ingress subjects and durable record
keys cannot carry it; the caller cannot know it, and a restart-stable key must not change,
so those two classes are fenced by the mechanism each admits: records by mediation (writer
table below), ingress by credential revocation with verified eviction (§13.1), never by
subject.

**Caller grants.** Minting maps each named capability to exact endpoint+command subjects:
publish on the request forms (class + instance) with the authz-mode/target pattern the
capability specifies, subscribe on the caller's own reply rail, publish on matching `epj`
submission subjects for journaled commands, and the exact record-key / event-topic subtrees
for attribute/event read capabilities (per-goal containment rides the caller triple in the
topic). The caller's lifecycle UID token is pinned in every granted subject, so a credential
is dead against its principal's next lifecycle by construction. Wildcards are bounded: `*` in
the command position only when the capability covers every command of the endpoint; `*` in
the endpoint position never, outside operator/admin profiles; `child`/`ledger` mode subjects
are never covered by an `owner`-mode wildcard. `describe` is granted by default for all
endpoints; a space MAY narrow it. Because the subject shape is verb-invariant (§13.2), one
publish row covers call and cast of a command. Minted credentials MUST stay within the
deployment's JWT size envelope, and the envelope is validated against a **normative
maximum-capability fixture**, not an adjective: the reference fixture is an agent holding
every baseline grant plus capabilities on 3 endpoints x 12 commands each, each targeted
command in both `self` and `owner` modes, plus journaled submissions and per-goal read
scopes for all of them. Minting MUST fail loud before emitting a credential that exceeds the
policy gate (reference: 16 KiB); the transport bound is the CONNECT control line
(`max_control_line`, §13.12) and the policy gate MUST be the tighter of the two. The fixture
set additionally includes a **maximum-command serve credential** (a 12-command endpoint's
per-command rows, below); the §13.12 operator assertion uses the largest encoded CONNECT
line in the set.

**Serve grants.** Serving is granted authority, dual to calling. On the **subscribe side**
an instance's credential binds its registered service name, stable instance id, and
**registered command set**, one queue-qualified subscribe row per registered command
(matrix below), never a bare `>` tail spanning commands the instance did not register. The
per-command enumeration is affordable precisely where the caller-side equivalent is not:
serve credentials are one per instance, a handful per space, with no capability-count
scaling pressure. The subscribe side deliberately does NOT bind the epoch; a caller cannot
name the serving epoch, so no request subject carries it and **ingress cannot be
epoch-fenced by subject**; the fence for a superseded subscriber is the §13.1 takeover
barrier (revoke + cluster-verified eviction), not a grant shape. On the **publish side** the
credential binds the epoch everywhere it is real: the epoch-pinned reply prefix, the
epoch-pinned `epe` event plane, its `ept` timer schedule requests, and its `epr`
record-write ingress. Session subjects are
deliberately absent from the standing serve grant: both sides of a session hold only
redemption-minted per-session credentials (§13.6); no standing EPS grant exists on either
side. The credential also carries the record keys the writer table assigns it and, where
the endpoint owns a work pool, the pool's consumer + ack grants (§13.5; matrix below).
Nothing else. Every "binds X" in this paragraph has a matrix row below that actually binds
X. Serve
credentials are re-minted on takeover (new epoch, §13.1 barrier); a superseded credential's
replies and commits are rejectable by epoch. Core names require operator provisioning
authority; reverse-DNS names bind to their registered owner. The registry is discovery; the
serve grant is the authority: a foreign credential cannot subscribe a class rail, answer as
an instance, or enter a frozen scatter set.

**Remote manager-service grant.** The server-authored `manager-service` view is an
instance-scoped authority family, not a reusable host profile. Its generated grant is the exact
union of the one manager instance's serve rows, its one service registration/status mediator,
its staged contract-publication row, `epgate.manager.<instanceId>`, and
`epcred.manager.<instanceId>.<credentialId>`; no wildcard may span an instance, manager actor,
owner, endpoint, record kind, contract digest, or credential id. The trusted auth path alone owns
gate/ledger writes and all host signing. The manager service's descendant-provision request is
mediated by that host path and MUST re-derive the requested agent's owner from the authenticated
caller, require it to equal the manager-service owner, and fresh-validate the active grant before
minting any child material. It is never a raw provisioner, stream, KV, consumer, signer, or
cross-owner control grant. The registration and renewal operations are typed/idempotent as §13.6
requires, and their stage records remain inaccessible to every ordinary agent, observer, admin,
or managed-agent exchange.

**The ownership matrix (normative).** Every profile × resource × transition is classified
**mediated** or **direct**, in an independently reviewed matrix from which grants are
generated (never the reverse). Each row names the writer PROFILE, the exact subject/API
namespace (including the queue qualifier where one applies; the grant grammar has a queue
dimension, §13.2), the operation, and the enforcement class; **read, consume, ack, and
delete authority are rows in the same table**, never prose that "follows" it. Every
credential and every audit probe is generated from these rows.

**Consumer-name grammar (normative).** Every consumer a row names has a pinned name grammar
(dash-form, §2; `<e>` is the endpoint-name token, `<uid>` the holder's lifecycleUid or
instanceId): `canonD = canon_<e>` (the canonicalizer durable), `poolD = pool_<e>_<pool>`
(the pool durable, **pre-created by the provisioner** with exact filter
`cotal.<space>.epw.<e>.<pool>.>`, the §8 item-3 pattern: the bare create form is
body-filter-selectable and is granted to NO ONE on control-surface streams), `timerD =
timerw_<space>` (the timer writer durable), `recwD-k = recw_<space>-<kind>` (one record
writer durable PER RECORD KIND, §13.9), `effD = eff_<e>` (the endpoint's ONE shared
effects durable; below), `goalD = goal_<uid>-<e>` (the caller's own goal-result durable).
Every composite name is **collision-free by construction**, and
each derivation states why: `pool_<e>_<pool>` parses uniquely from its LAST `_` because a
pool token contains no `_` (`[a-z0-9-]`) while `<e>` may (a dash separator would be
ambiguous, both tokens admit `-`); `dec_<uid>-<e>` parses from its FIRST `-` because
`<uid>` is `[a-z0-9]` and contains none, and `goal_<uid>-<e>` likewise; `eve_<uid>-<e>-<gid>-<n>`
carries TWO `-`-adjacent soft components (`<e>` and `<gid>`), so `<gid>` is constrained
SEPARATOR-FREE (`[a-z0-9]`, no `-` or `_`): then `<uid>` (leading, `-`-free), `<n>` (trailing
digits) and `<gid>` (separator-free) are each a single token off their edges, leaving `<e>` as
the only `-`-bearing component with an unambiguous extent (`eve_<uid>-a-b-c-0` can ONLY be
endpoint `a-b`/gid `c`, never endpoint `a`/gid `b-c`). `rec_<uid>-<gid>-<n>` has one soft
component `<gid>` bounded by `-`-free `<uid>` and digit `<n>`. Without the separator-free `<gid>`
the two grants above would collide on one durable name. A derivation that cannot state its
collision-freedom argument is non-conformant. Reader consumers use **mint-time-enumerated LITERAL names**, and every one
is **pre-created by the provisioner at capability mint as a PULL durable with its exact
filter; the holder receives BIND-ONLY grants** (INFO/MSG.NEXT/ACK, never CREATE or
DELETE): `decD = dec_<uid>-<e>` (one per journal capability), `goalD = goal_<uid>-<e>`
(one per action capability),
`eveD = eve_<uid>-<e>-<gid>-<n>` and `recD = rec_<uid>-<gid>-<n>` (one per granted subtree;
`<gid>` is the **grant id**, a short stable SEPARATOR-FREE (`[a-z0-9]`) id the provisioner
assigns per minted capability grant, so two independent capability mints for one lifecycle UID
never collide AND the `<e>`/`<gid>` boundary stays unambiguous, and `<n>` is
the subtree's zero-based index within THAT grant, sorted lexicographically at mint; the
deprovision key is `<uid>-<gid>`, so revoking one capability deletes exactly its own reader
durables and cannot reach a sibling capability's). Two reasons, both
load-bearing. A NATS wildcard replaces a
WHOLE dot-separated token and never matches inside one, so an embedded `*` in a name token
(e.g. `dec_<uid>-*`) is a literal character, not a glob; every name token in a grant is
fully literal.

**Mediated reads (normative).** No untrusted capability holder is granted **any** raw
JetStream read of a control-surface stream, not a consumer create, not a bind-only pull,
not a `DIRECT.GET`. Every JetStream read is request/reply where the server delivers stored
bytes to a **caller-chosen destination the broker does not confine to the caller's
`pub.allow`**: a push consumer's `deliver_subject`, a pull `MSG.NEXT` request's reply
subject, and a `DIRECT.GET` request's reply subject are all set in the request body, and the
server's internal client publishes there regardless of the requester's publish permissions.
A holder with only `MSG.NEXT` or
`DIRECT.GET` on its own filtered reader can therefore route stored bytes onto a victim's DM,
reply, or record subject, a confused deputy no filter tail, literal name, or pull-vs-push
choice prevents, because the destination is the vulnerable field, not the filter. Untrusted
callers instead read exactly as the §8 durable backstop already does, through a **trusted
read path**, never a self-bound consumer: a caller receives its decisions, goal results,
event catch-up, and record reads over its OWN confined rails, a live core subscription to a
subject inside its `sub.allow` (bytes land only on the caller's own subscription), or a
mediator that owns the reader consumer, re-authorizes each read against the caller's current
grants, and returns bytes over the caller's own attribution-pinned reply rail
(`ep.reply.…<caller triple>.<nonce>`: the mediator holds the publish grant, the caller the
read grant, and the nonce confines addressing, §13.2). The mediator IS a trusted
single-purpose principal (the delivery/read daemon, §8/Appendix B) that delivers only to the
re-authorized caller and never proxies to an arbitrary subject; raw
consumer/`DIRECT.GET`/`STREAM.MSG.GET`
authority stays with trusted single-purpose infra principals (canonicalizer, commit
principal, record writer, timer writer, the read mediator, the auth path) that deliver to
themselves. This contract fixes the boundary; untrusted callers never hold raw reads; reads
are mediated onto confined caller rails, and leaves the read-command wire shape (batching,
cursors, flow control) to the reference implementation.
**Subject convention:**
application subjects in rows are written relative and are prefixed `cotal.<space>.` on the
wire; **JetStream API tails (extended-create filter tails and `DIRECT.GET` subject
tails) are always spelled in FULL** (`cotal.<space>.…`/`$KV.…`/`$O.…`), because the API
subject embeds the stored subject verbatim and a relative tail matches nothing (the
streams capture `cotal.<space>.ep*.>`, §13.12).
The grep tests the matrix MUST pass: the only `CONSUMER.CREATE` grants below belong to
trusted provisioning/infra profiles and each carries a full literal filter tail; every
consumer-name token in a grant is a LITERAL (no embedded `*`); every filter or Direct-Get
tail is fully qualified; **no UNTRUSTED profile (agent/observer/admin) holds any
`CONSUMER.CREATE`/`MSG.NEXT`/`DIRECT.GET`/`STREAM.MSG.GET` on a control-surface resource** (an
audit MUST run this over Appendix B too, not only this matrix; the profile tables are
generated from these rows, so a generated grant that contradicts the matrix fails the build);
and the ONLY `STREAM.MSG.GET` (body-selected) grants that exist at all are the leader-served
reads of named TRUSTED single-purpose profiles, each granted to no other profile - every one
a FENCING read (read service, below) except where its row names it a CAS-PINNING read, a
leader-served currency read whose FENCE is the pinned CAS write it feeds (§13.1: a read is
never a fence): the auth path on `KV_cotal_auth_<space>`, the lifecycle mapping-reader and
the provisioner-registration principal on the `cotal_records_<space>` heads, the endpoint's
canonicalizer on `EPF_<space>`/`EPW_<space>`, the endpoint's commit principal on its own
`EPF_<space>` fact families AND on `KV_cotal_records_<space>` (its goal/checkpoint FENCING
spec-and-currency reads: the terminal-commit's spec read and the epoch/deadline reads the
read-service clause names), each record kind's spec/status writer principal on
`KV_cotal_records_<space>` (its fresh lifecycle-mapping `processEpoch` currency read, the
writer-table stale-writer fence; per §13.1 a mapping yields a current epoch ONLY at
`state: "active"`, and `retiring`/`retired` alike refuse the write), and the space's timer writer on
`KV_cotal_records_<space>` (its fresh generation/deadline check before arming, a FENCING
read) and on `EPT_<space>` (`$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.EPT_<space>`, the armed-subject's own
last-by-subject sequence read: CAS-PINNING, the leader-served input to the arm's
`Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence` publish, whose broker CAS - not the read - is the
fence, the same §13.1 complementarity class as the FIRE handler's status CAS). The timer
FIRE handler holds no records `STREAM.MSG.GET`: its settlement is a revision-pinned status
CAS, so a stale read loses the CAS loudly (§13.1 complementarity), never mis-fires (the
matrix rows below). The body-selected form is not
subject-confinable by the broker, so each of these grants trades broker confinement for
profile trust; the trade is acceptable exactly because every holder IS a trusted
single-purpose principal for whom read-your-writes is a correctness requirement, not a
hazard (on the `allow_direct=false` buckets a leader-consistent get is precisely a
`STREAM.MSG.GET`). Every OTHER subject-scoped read is NON-fencing and uses the
last-by-subject `DIRECT.GET.<stream>.<subject>` form, which the broker confines by subject
tokens. (The pre-v0.4 messaging-surface CHKV/DLVKV reads in Appendix B are the v0.3 binding,
outside this matrix; their confused-deputy exposure is the §9 in-scope-for-v0.4 remediation.)

**Read service (fencing reads are leader-served).** A read is FENCING when its result, a
value, a revision, OR an authoritative ABSENCE, gates a subsequent CAS or authorizes an
effect; fencing is defined by USE, never by subject family. A CAS loser reading the winner,
a terminal-commit's spec read, and the work-pool re-enqueue predicate (accepted, with the
authoritative absence of BOTH a committed terminal and a live `EPW` entry, §13.6) are all
fencing: a stale follower read that misses a committed terminal while the `EPW` entry is
legitimately absent re-arms settled work. A fencing read MUST be leader-served, meaning one
of `STREAM.MSG.GET`, a get against a bucket with `allow_direct=false`, or delivery
serialized by the authoritative primary stream/consumer (an authoritative `MSG.NEXT`, e.g.
the accepted-fact effects row and the auth path's snapshot enumeration below), and it MUST
be served against the AUTHORITATIVE stream or bucket for its key, never a mirror, a sourced
stream, or a cross-space replica ("leader-served" means that authoritative primary; a
mirror's own leader can lag its source). `allow_direct=true` and Direct Get exist for
NON-fencing, subject-confined reads only; a client MUST NOT let a fencing read silently
ride Direct Get because the bucket allows it. This does not weaken §13.1's rule that a read
is never a fence: the fence itself stays a CAS or create-only write; leader service is what
keeps the read's result from silently falsifying the CAS or effect it feeds.

| Transition | Writer profile | Exact namespace (per space/endpoint) | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Request publish | capability holder (agent, per capability) | per §13.2 form: `ep.{one,all}.<endpoint>.<command>[.<mode>[.<target tokens per mode>]].<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.*` and `ep.inst.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<command>[.<mode>[.<target tokens per mode>]].<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.*`, mode/target tokens literal per the minted capability (`handle`: the full redemption-pinned triple) | direct, untrusted input, broker-confined |
| Reply subscribe (caller) | capability holder | `ep.reply.*.*.*.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.*` (exact arity) | direct read; own rail only |
| Serve subscribe | the endpoint's serve credential | per registered command: `"ep.one.<endpoint>.<command>.> <endpoint>"` (queue-qualified ONLY), `ep.all.<endpoint>.<command>.>` plain, `ep.inst.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<command>.>` exact (never a cross-command `>` | direct) name/instance/command-pinned; epoch deliberately absent (§13.1 barrier is the fence) |
| Reply publish | the endpoint's serve credential | `ep.reply.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.*.*.*.*` | direct; attribution-pinned; addressing by nonce |
| Journal submission append | capability holder | `epj.<endpoint>.<command>[.<mode>[.<target tokens per mode>]].<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>` | direct, explicitly untrusted input |
| Canonicalizer consume | the endpoint's canonicalizer principal (singleton, §13.4) | its durable on `EPJ_<space>`: `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.EPJ_<space>.<canonD>.cotal.<space>.epj.<endpoint>.>` (full-tail single filter), `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.EPJ_<space>.<canonD>`, `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.EPJ_<space>.<canonD>`, plus `$JS.ACK.EPJ_<space>.<canonD>.>` (ack/term after durable decision only, and, for pool-admitted acceptances, after the enqueue, §13.4) | mediated |
| Canonical decisions + quarantine + goal-bind | the endpoint's canonicalizer principal | publish `epf.<endpoint>.dec.>`, `epf.<endpoint>.quar.>`, and `epf.<endpoint>.goal.*.*.*.*.bind` (the per-goal first-wins bind, §13.4, create-only CAS per subject; the `.bind` leaf is disjoint from the commit principal's `goal….result`/status writes, so no writer overlap) | mediated |
| Canonicalizer CAS-winner + terminal read | the endpoint's canonicalizer principal | leader-served `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.EPF_<space>` (body-selected `last_by_subj`; these reads are FENCING, read service above, so the follower-served `$JS.API.DIRECT.GET.EPF_<space>.…` form is NOT granted; the body-selected form is the broker-confinement-for-profile-trust trade above) over exactly its families: `epf.<endpoint>.dec.>` + `epf.<endpoint>.quar.>` (observes the winning fact on redelivery, §13.4) + `epf.<endpoint>.wrk.>` (READ-ONLY: the reconciliation predicate's terminal probe, §13.6; `wrk` writes stay with the commit principal, row below) + `epf.<endpoint>.goal.*.*.*.*.bind` (the goal-bind CAS winner: on a lost `.bind` create the canonicalizer reads the existing bind to decide same-fingerprint retry vs. `conflict`, §13.4) | mediated |
| Caller durable reads (decisions, goal results, receipts, event catch-up, record reads/watches) | the **read mediator** owns the reader consumers; the **caller** holds only its own reply rail | **Mediated (normative above).** The caller holds NO consumer/`DIRECT.GET` grant on EPF/EPE/EPC/records. It issues a read command and receives its own caller-scoped facts (`dec`/`goal…result`/`receipt` under its triple, §13.2), event catch-up, and record snapshots over its attribution-pinned reply rail `ep.reply.…<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.<nonce>`; the mediator re-authorizes each read against the caller's current grants before delivering. Live progress is the caller's own core subscription to granted `epe` subtrees within `sub.allow` (bytes land only on its own sub). Reader consumers (`decD`/`goalD`/`eveD`/`recD`) are owned and bound by the mediator, never the caller | mediated read; confined to the caller's own rails |
| Accepted-fact consume (effects) | every instance's serve credential, on the endpoint's ONE shared durable | **bind-only** on the provisioner-pre-created pull durable `effD = eff_<e>` (exact filter `cotal.<space>.epf.<endpoint>.dec.>`, `AckExplicit`): `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.EPF_<space>.<effD>`, `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.EPF_<space>.<effD>`, `$JS.ACK.EPF_<space>.<effD>.>`; instances **pull-compete on the shared durable** so each accepted decision is delivered to exactly one live instance (at-least-once): a per-instance consumer over the class-wide decision subtree would be broadcast, and every instance would duplicate the external effect. Effects consume canonical facts, never raw submissions (§13.4); a rejected/quarantined decision is ack-skipped, and so is any acceptance whose `route` is a pool (§13.4, the pool's worker path executes it; effects MUST NOT). **Ack barrier:** an effecting instance MUST ack a `dec` message ONLY after its effect is durably recorded, for an action command the terminal `goal….result` fact; for a **non-action `route:"effects"` journal command** a generic per-request **effect fact** `epf.<endpoint>.eff.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.<id>` (create-only CAS, written by the effecting instance's commit path before ack; every `route:"effects"` acceptance has exactly this durable effect-complete marker), never before; an ack-before-effect would let a crash drop journal work the at-least-once contract promised. A crash before the ack redelivers the decision to another competing instance, which observes the existing terminal fact (idempotent) or effects it | direct read, endpoint-scoped, work-shared |
| Result/receipt/terminal/resume facts | the endpoint's commit principal | enumerated fact families, no subtraction and **never `dec.>`/`quar.>`** (canonicalizer-only): publish `epf.<endpoint>.goal.*.*.*.*.result` (the goal terminal result; the `.bind` leaf under `goal.>` is the canonicalizer's, row above), `epf.<endpoint>.eff.>` (per-request effect-complete fact for non-action `route:"effects"` commands, create-only CAS, §13.9 ack barrier), `epf.<endpoint>.receipt.>` (caller-scoped subjects, §13.2), `epf.<endpoint>.wrk.>` (per-item terminal, create-only CAS), `epf.<endpoint>.cp.>` (one-use resume CAS); read-back is FENCING (read service above: it gates create-only CAS emission and idempotent re-commit decisions), leader-served `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.EPF_<space>` (body-selected `last_by_subj` over exactly these five families; the follower-served per-family `DIRECT.GET` form is NOT granted) | mediated |
| Live event progress (caller) | capability holder (per read capability) | a caller-owned **core subscription** to the granted `epe` subtrees (fully-qualified `cotal.<space>.epe.…` in `sub.allow`, Appendix B), incl. per-goal `epe.<endpoint>.*.*.goal.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.>`; safe because a core sub delivers only to the caller's own subscription, never a caller-chosen subject; durable catch-up/replay is the mediated read above, not a self-bound consumer | direct read; own subscription only |
| Claim / action / checkpoint commits | the owning endpoint's commit path | its own record keys (`goal`/`cp`/`lease`/`goaleff`/`epname`/`epmig` grammars, §13.7, per the writer table; the three coordination kinds are enumerated HERE because a shared registry profile does not confer a grant; a kind absent from this enumeration is default-denied however it is registered, and that default-deny binds every principal in this table, including the composed profile in the row below) + the enumerated commit fact families of the Result row above, never `dec.>`/`quar.>`; its goal/checkpoint FENCING reads (the terminal-commit's spec read, epoch/deadline currency) are leader-served `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.KV_cotal_records_<space>` (read service above; the records bucket's Direct Get is NON-fencing only) | mediated (validates fencing, lease clock, lifecycle, epoch) |
| Goal-writer commits (journal-class actions) | the **goal-writer** principal: the commit principal of the row above, composed with three additions and nothing else | the composed profile is exactly (i) everything the commit row grants, inherited rather than restated, (ii) the per-goal first-wins bind leaf `epf.<endpoint>.goal.*.*.*.*.bind`, (iii) the reconcile index subtree `goalidx.<endpoint>.>` in the records bucket, key-pinned to this endpoint, and (iv) a currency read of its OWN issuance gate `epgate.<endpoint>.<instanceId>` before the first terminal-fact CAS, so a superseded writer declines to commit. That read carries the NAMED RESIDUAL this section requires of every bucket-blind read: the auth store is not Direct-Get enabled, so the read is a leader-served body-selected `STREAM.MSG.GET` that cannot be key-pinned to the single gate key, and the profile can therefore read any row of that bucket's gate and ledger METADATA, never bearer bytes. It is the same residual class the one-shot serve-executor profile carries, here on a standing connection, and it is a fast-fail belt rather than the fence; the durable fence is barrier revocation. `goalidx` is enumerated HERE and NOT on the commit row, because the index is written create-only BEFORE the goal binds, so the principal that writes it is the one that also binds; granting it on the bare commit row would widen every commit principal to a key only this profile needs. This profile holds NO records consumer create: the sweep that enumerates the index runs over the provisioner (row below), never over this standing connection, which is why an index write grant is not an index enumeration grant | mediated (as the commit row, plus the bind's create-only CAS per subject) |
| Contract-artifact publication | the contract publisher principal | publish `epc.<digest-hex>` (`epc.*`), create-only per subject (`Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence: 0`; a digest subject is written at most once); read-back via the reader row below | mediated, immutable once published |
| Contract-artifact read | trusted infra directly (`DIRECT.GET.EPC_<space>.cotal.<space>.epc.>`); untrusted callers via the read mediator | contract artifacts are content-addressed and public (verify-on-read is the tamper boundary, §13.7), so exposure is not the risk; the confused-deputy INJECTION is, so an untrusted caller's artifact fetch is mediated onto its own reply rail exactly like any other read; trusted infra fetches directly | mediated for callers / direct for infra |
| Record write ingress (`epr`) | the owning instance | publish `epr.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.<kind>.<qualifier...>`; the instance's ONLY path to `svc`/`goal`/`cp` status writes; the epoch token is pinned by the serve credential, so the record writer reads the writing epoch from the broker-authenticated subject, never from payload | direct; epoch-pinned ingress to the mediated writer |
| Record writer consume + `spec`/`status` writes | the kind's separately scoped spec/status writer principal (writer table); **one principal and one consumer PER KIND**, never a single writer draining every kind | consume: `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.EPR_<space>.<recwD-k>.cotal.<space>.epr.*.*.*.<kind>.>` (full-tail single filter on the `<kind>` token of §13.2's `epr` grammar; `recwD-k = recw_<space>-<kind>`) + `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.EPR_<space>.<recwD-k>` + `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.EPR_<space>.<recwD-k>` + `$JS.ACK.EPR_<space>.<recwD-k>.>`; write: `$KV.cotal_records_<space>.<that kind's §13.7 key grammar>.{spec,status}`; its writer-table stale-writer fence (the FRESH lifecycle-mapping `processEpoch` currency read; current ONLY at `state: "active"`, §13.1, so a `retiring` or `retired` mapping refuses the write) is leader-served `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.KV_cotal_records_<space>` (a FENCING read, read service above); the kind token in the ingress subject is what keeps the writer separation the writer table declares | mediated per kind below, no row left open |
| Reader/pool/effects consumer provisioning (one-shot, at capability mint / endpoint setup) | the provisioner | exact full-tail extended creates for every pre-created durable this matrix names: `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.EPW_<space>.<poolD>.cotal.<space>.epw.<e>.<pool>.>`, `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.EPF_<space>.<effD>.cotal.<space>.epf.<e>.dec.>`, `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.EPF_<space>.<decD>.cotal.<space>.epf.<e>.dec.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.>`, `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.EPF_<space>.<goalD>.cotal.<space>.epf.<e>.goal.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.>` (per action capability), `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.EPE_<space>.<eveD-n>.<granted full-tail subtree>`, `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.KV_cotal_records_<space>.<recD-n>.$KV.cotal_records_<space>.<granted subtree>` (the reader-config seam is an ALLOWLIST: the `<granted subtree>` kind token MUST be a registered caller-readable record kind, so it REFUSES every authority-control kind (`oblig` above all, plus `govern`/`policy`/`uid`/`frontier`) and every unregistered kind, and for a dual-token kind whose atomic head is authority (`lifecycle`, head `lifecycle.<owner>.<actor>`) it admits only a filter strictly deeper than the head, never one that can match the head key itself; so no reader durable is ever pre-created over the `oblig.` subtree the sealed records scanner owns nor over an authority head, nats-server#8274), every create PULL, every filter a full literal tail; plus matching `CONSUMER.DELETE` for deprovisioning (lifecycle-keyed names, §13.1) | mediated, trusted provisioning only |
| Events | the owning instance | `epe.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.>` | direct; subject-confined, epoch-pinned |
| Timer schedule request | the owning instance | publish `ept.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.*.schedule` (never `.armed`/`.fire`); a request carrying any scheduling header is rejected by the timer writer (§13.2) | direct; epoch-pinned; captured by the schedules-DISABLED request stream |
| Timer request consume + arm | the space's timer writer principal (singleton infra, like the delivery daemon) | consume: `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.EPT_REQ_<space>.<timerD>.cotal.<space>.ept.*.*.*.*.schedule` (full-tail single filter) + `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.EPT_REQ_<space>.<timerD>` + `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.EPT_REQ_<space>.<timerD>` + `$JS.ACK.EPT_REQ_<space>.<timerD>.>`; arm: publish `ept.*.*.*.*.armed`, deriving `Nats-Schedule-Target` = the sibling `.fire` from the authenticated request subject tokens ONLY, stripping/rejecting every client scheduling header, and **fresh-checking the authoritative timer generation/deadline before arming** (a FENCING read: leader-served `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.KV_cotal_records_<space>` on the checkpoint record, read service above); the arm also reads the armed-subject's own last sequence via `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.EPT_<space>` and publishes with `Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence` pinned to it - that read is CAS-PINNING, not fencing: the broker CAS is the fence and a delayed writer's stale read loses it loudly (§13.1 complementarity, the FIRE handler's class); a redelivered or delayed stale-generation request is discarded, never armed, so it cannot overwrite the current schedule and silently lose the live deadline (§13.2, §13.6, §13.12) | mediated |
| Timer fire consume | the owning instance | its own `ept.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<epoch>.*.fire` (fired messages validated against its authoritative schedule state AND the broker-authored scheduler-origin header = its exact sibling `.armed`, §13.12); no client credential holds `.armed` or `.fire` publish | direct read |
| Session `.in` publish | the session's caller (per-session credential) | `eps.<endpoint>.<sessionId>.<epoch>.in` exact | direct |
| Session `.in` subscribe | the serving instance (per-session credential) | `eps.<endpoint>.<sessionId>.<epoch>.in` exact | direct read |
| Session `.out` publish | the serving instance (per-session credential) | `eps.<endpoint>.<sessionId>.<epoch>.out` exact | direct |
| Session `.out` subscribe | the session's caller (per-session credential) | `eps.<endpoint>.<sessionId>.<epoch>.out` exact | direct read |
| Session ledger (one-use redemption, credential ids, revocation state, authenticated close) | the trusted auth path (§9/§10) | `$KV.cotal_auth_<space>.session.<sessionId>`, create-only CAS per `sessionId`, monotonic state (§13.6) | mediated |
| Credential ledger (issuance gate, descendant enumeration, lineage index, revocation) | the trusted auth path (§9/§10) | writes: `$KV.cotal_auth_<space>.cred.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` + `….gate.<lifecycleUid>` (the issuance gate, revision-pinned CAS is the mint fence, §13.1) + `….epgate.<endpoint>.<instanceId>` + `….epcred.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<credentialId>` (the disjoint endpoint gate/credential families, §13.1: same protocol, explicit prefixes, never arity) + `….stage.>` (implementation staging/tombstone fences; NEVER under `cred.`/`epcred.`, §13.1) + `….srcgate.<issuerKeyId>.<id>` (per-handle source gate, §13.1) + `….bysrc.<issuerKeyId>.<id>.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` (the per-ancestor lineage index) + `….session.<sessionId>` (create-CAS `issuing`, finalize-CAS `active`, §13.6) + `….plane` (the ONE plane-ownership claim row, §13.13: create/revision-CAS by the barrier profile only, exact arity, never `plane.>`); reads: **leader-served `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.KV_cotal_auth_<space>`** (with `allow_direct=false` a KV get is exactly this body-selected `last_by_subj` call against the stream LEADER; read-your-writes, not a follower-served `DIRECT.GET`; the body-selection is safe here because this profile IS the trusted auth path, and it is granted to no other profile) for gate/session/row state, which is why the mint and session fences are revision-pinned CAS *writes* rather than reads (a read is never a fence, §13.1); and **fence-free prefix enumeration through the SEALED auth-ledger scanner, never a runtime consumer create**: no standing or runtime-reachable auth credential (the takeover/retirement/handle-revocation barrier, the session sweep, any replayable executor) holds `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE` on `cotal_auth_<space>`, because a consumer-create request BODY is not subject-ACL confinable: an extended `CONSUMER.CREATE.<stream>.<name>.<filter>` grant still admits a body with `durable_name` (equal to the subject name token) and a push `deliver_subject`, a DURABLE exporter of every current and future row that SURVIVES the credential's connection close and revocation; a subject ACL cannot constrain that body, so the only safe runtime grant is none. The dynamic-enumeration `CONSUMER.CREATE` lives in exactly ONE profile, a SEALED scanner the trusted auth process opens for itself and NEVER hands out: its credential, connection, and identity seed reach no caller, child, log, or persistence (a process-memory compromise reaches it, the SAME residual class as the account signing seed the process already holds; never broker confinement, never a network-reachable JWT). The scanner is pinned to ONE literal consumer name under a FORCED config: pull (no `deliver_subject`), ephemeral (no `durable_name`), `AckPolicy.None`, `DeliverPolicy.LastPerSubject`, memory storage, bounded inactivity; re-read and bind-verified before use and unconditionally deleted after, with every scan over the stream serialized on that one name, and the injected scanner bonded to its exact space so a hand-assembled or foreign-space scanner never enumerates. The scan is FENCE-FREE by construction: under the history=1 store a same-subject `active→revoked` overwrite EVICTS the pre-scan revision, so a sequence/`STREAM.INFO` cutoff would DROP that subject and leave its holder un-revoked; a LastPerSubject read carries no upper cutoff and, draining to a freshly re-observed zero pending (never a stale local count), returns each subject's CURRENT last, so a concurrent overwrite is SEEN, never dropped. It enumerates exactly `cred.<lifecycleUid>.>`, `bysrc.<issuerKeyId>.<id>.>`, `stage.>` (operation-intent discovery), or `session.>`. The barrier's family enumeration and the expiry sweep are executable reads, not prose. No profile OTHER than the sealed scanner and this trusted write path holds ANY grant on `cotal_auth_<space>` | mediated |
| Remote manager-service registration and renewal (§13.1/§13.6) | the trusted auth path is the sole gate/ledger writer and host JWT issuer; a user manager presents only the server-authored closed view | exactly one staged `{ owner, managerActor, lifecycleUid, instanceId }` family: `svc.manager.<instanceId>`, the stage-pinned contract artifacts, `epgate.manager.<instanceId>`, and `epcred.manager.<instanceId>.<credentialId>`. `prepare` freezes/stages; `activate` creates the matching service record and releases host-signed material only after ledger + gate finalization; `renew` is bounded, rechecks the live ledger scope, and can replace material only inside that family. Descendant provisioning is a mediated same-owner request revalidated by the host.

The fence-free `LastPerSubject` enumeration `CONSUMER.CREATE` lives in exactly ONE profile: a sealed records scanner the trusted process opens for itself and NEVER hands out (its credential, connection, and seed reach no caller; the same process-memory residual class as the auth-ledger scanner), pinned to ONE literal consumer name under a FORCED pull/ephemeral/`AckPolicy.None`/`DeliverPolicy.LastPerSubject`/memory config, bind-verified before use and unconditionally deleted after, its CREATE filter confined to the `oblig.` subtree, and the injected scanner bonded to its exact space so a hand-assembled or foreign-space scanner never enumerates; its fencing `STREAM.MSG.GET` rows are stream-level grants whose read exposure is space-wide, explicit per D32 (the terminal-cleanup row's same read residual); its reply inbox is connection-scoped (`_INBOX_<connId>.>`, never the account-wide default); the rows are NEVER-DELETED, a WRITER discipline the broker cannot fully enforce: the raw KV publish grant is operation/header-blind, so a compromised mediator can overwrite its own endpoint's row to a valid `terminal` value (hiding cleanup debt) or emit DEL/PURGE markers, where every reader refuses a deletion marker loud as corruption (§13.12 retention floor) and the records stream denies stream-API message-delete/purge, leaving the valid-row overwrite as a second explicit D32 residual, exactly parallel to the decision-forge residual and confined the same way (its own endpoint's rows only) | mediated |

| Retirement settlement (§13.1 barrier executor) | the retirement barrier's op-bounded executor: a DISTINCT per-operation principal (`local.epexe_<opId-hash>`, CONNZ principal-tagged) minted per (op × endpoint) over this operation's EFFECTIVE INVENTORY bound to the durable intent (`opId`, target lifecycle; the pools are the target's accepted `oblig.<uid>.>` routes, DISCOVERY-ONLY (no caller-supplied hint)), its settlement code running on ITS OWN connection, live only for that operation and revoked + cluster-verified-evicted by the barrier at the same fence as the cleaner, BEFORE any frontier records; never the cleaner profile, never the barrier's standing connection, never a standing grant | the settlement seam is EFFECTIVE-INVENTORY-CLOSED: for every item the cleaner hands it, the executor re-derives the authority coordinates from the item's durable acceptance decision (a FENCING leader-served read; cleaner-supplied coordinates never authorize) and refuses a ref whose endpoint or pool is outside its EFFECTIVE-INVENTORY spec (the discovered pools), a decision that is not an accepted pool admission, an `expired` request before the item's OWN `workExpiry`, and a `retired` request for an accepted target that is not the intent's lifecycle (the confused-deputy closure: a cleaner chooses refs but can never borrow this authority beyond that effective inventory or the retirement lifecycle); it settles by CASing the item's `lease.<endpoint>.<pool>.<acceptance>.spec` record to a settled state, where the ONLY settlements it may INITIATE are `expired` (bound to the item's own horizon) and `retired` (re-bound to ITS operation's retiring target through the acceptance) and an ALREADY-settled lease DOMINATES (a crashed owner's `committed` lease is derived and its terminal published verbatim, never overwritten, never contradicted), then publishes/observes the exact lease-derived `wrk` terminal create-only (first terminal wins, §13.8 cancellation ordering) for the cleaner to validate; its authority is lease-record CAS plus `epf.<endpoint>.wrk.<pool>.>` publish on its effective-inventory pools plus the leader-served fencing reads its own code path performs (`STREAM.MSG.GET` on the facts stream and on the records store, plus the records store's bind-probe `STREAM.INFO` and `$JS.API.INFO`; NO work-stream read: the settlement path always settles or expires through the lease key before any EPW live-entry probe, so that read is unreachable and ungranted) and its connection-scoped reply inbox, and NOTHING else (no consumer authority anywhere, no work-enqueue publish, no auth-store access), and it carries the write residual the bounded cleaner does NOT: KV subject permissions cannot distinguish CAS from overwrite or DEL/PURGE markers, and the `wrk` publish is payload-blind, so a compromised executor can forge a lease settlement or work terminal within its WHOLE EFFECTIVE INVENTORY (every discovered pool; the per-item checks above bind honest execution, not a compromised bearer), explicit per D32, op-bounded and effective-inventory-confined, never standing, never beyond that inventory | mediated |
| Drain commit applier (§13.8 accepted-self recovery) | a per-op, per-repair principal (`local.epapl_<opId-hash>`, CONNZ principal-tagged) the retirement drain mints ONLY after the commit key passes the CLOSED self-commit class: the key's kind must resolve in the canonical frozen kind registry to a NON-authority definition whose targeted `spec`/`status` half is registered to the §13.8 commit-path writer, at exact arity (which structurally excludes every authority HEAD, including the 3-token lifecycle head) with every qualifier token validated; a key outside the class refuses BEFORE any credential exists (the confused-deputy closure: a forged accepted-self row cannot turn `oblig.`/`govern.`/`policy.`/`uid.`/`frontier.`/a lifecycle head/an unregistered kind into a granted coordinate) | exactly ONE `$KV.cotal_records_<space>.<commitKey>` publish row plus its connection-scoped reply inbox; NO reads, NO wildcards. It executes the mediator-validated command verbatim: the resolved, canonically digest-verified intent bytes at the pinned base revision, written by guarded CAS; a CAS loss reports the another-writer conflict and the drain's re-enumeration re-classifies (landed / superseded), never a blind retry. NAMED residual: KV subject permissions cannot distinguish CAS from overwrite or DEL/PURGE, so within its one granted key a compromised applier can overwrite or delete for the credential's short life — the confinement is the exact key, the closed class, and the op-bounded lifetime, never write semantics. RETIREMENT-FENCE residual (§13.1/§13.13): no credential-ledger row backs this bearer, so the retirement fence guarantees KILL-LIVE (cluster-verified eviction of any live connection before the frontier), never deny-new — the connection is minted non-reconnecting so a KICK is durable in one round, and a fresh connect with a still-unexpired held bearer+seed after that point-in-time scan is the accepted residual, dominated by data-account signing-seed compromise (signing-key rotation is the only true deny-new) | mediated |
| Drain route reconciler (§13.8 accepted-pool repair) | a per-op, per-repair principal (`local.eprec_<opId-hash>`, CONNZ principal-tagged) the retirement drain mints only to execute a MEDIATOR-DERIVED closed repair command: the mediator reads the item's durable acceptance decision itself (a leader-served fencing read), binds it to the obligation row (fingerprint/sourceSeq/route/horizon), and derives the exact EPW item subject plus the canonical acceptance item bytes (§13.6); the executor re-validates the exact six-token item shape for its own space and holds NO derivation authority (row-supplied coordinates or bytes never reach a grant) | exactly ONE `cotal.<space>.epw.<endpoint>.<pool>.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>` create-only publish row plus its connection-scoped reply inbox; a lost create is benign (a concurrent enqueue won; the drain re-reads establishment either way, so a no-op executor still fails closed); the payload-blind enqueue residual is confined to the one item subject for the credential's short life. RETIREMENT-FENCE residual (§13.1/§13.13): no credential-ledger row backs this bearer, so the retirement fence guarantees KILL-LIVE (cluster-verified eviction of any live connection before the frontier), never deny-new — the connection is minted non-reconnecting so a KICK is durable in one round, and a fresh connect with a still-unexpired held bearer+seed after that point-in-time scan is the accepted residual, dominated by data-account signing-seed compromise (signing-key rotation is the only true deny-new) | mediated |
| Drain effects canceller (§13.8 option-(i) retirement cancel) | a per-op, per-repair principal (`local.epcan_<opId-hash>`, CONNZ principal-tagged) the retirement drain mints only to execute a MEDIATOR-DERIVED effects-cancel repair: the mediator reads and row-binds the acceptance decision itself and derives the exact completion subject (the `eff` marker or the goal `result` coordinate; the executor re-validates that exact shape for its own space); the cancelled terminal is built by the CORE validated builders, which refuse a foreign or absent target — a retirement cancels only ITS OWN target's accepted work — and never fabricate success (the effects union's `cancelled` member, or the goal union's first-class `cancelled` state with the digest-bound retirement attribution) | exactly ONE completion-subject create-publish row plus its connection-scoped reply inbox; CREATE-ONLY, so first-terminal-wins is structural (a racing real completion that landed first wins and the cancel loses its create harmlessly; the drain re-reads the winner either way, so a no-op executor still fails closed); the payload-blind single-subject create residual is confined to the one marker for the credential's short life. RETIREMENT-FENCE residual (§13.1/§13.13): no credential-ledger row backs this bearer, so the retirement fence guarantees KILL-LIVE (cluster-verified eviction of any live connection before the frontier), never deny-new — the connection is minted non-reconnecting so a KICK is durable in one round, and a fresh connect with a still-unexpired held bearer+seed after that point-in-time scan is the accepted residual, dominated by data-account signing-seed compromise (signing-key rotation is the only true deny-new) | mediated |
| Auth endpoint rail (the `auth` listener, §13.2) | the auth service's dedicated LISTENER credential: serve + derived replies on the `ep.one.auth` class rail, standing with the plane. The surface is GENERIC — "retire a lifecycle (owner, actor, lifecycleUid)" — never caller-specific; the TARGET rides the subject as the `handle` triple (`ep.one.auth.retire-lifecycle.handle.<tO>.<tA>.<tUid>.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.<nonce>`) and caller attribution is the SUBJECT-derived, broker-ACL-enforced caller triple. The reply target is DERIVED from the parsed request (responder instance + caller triple + nonce), so no caller- or payload-supplied reply target can arrive at all — the bound-reply rule became structural rather than a check. Serve-time authz is the RAIL-TIME serve-issuance-gate check, fresh per request: ONE leader-served `STREAM.MSG.GET` of `epgate.<serveEndpoint>.<serveInstanceId>` — coordinates the caller NAMES but which do NOT authorize — requiring (a) the row is present and not `retired`, (b) `row.principal == principalKey(callerOwner, callerActor)` (THE PRINCIPAL CROSS-CHECK: a caller may only be authorized by its OWN serve registration; naming a foreign row buys a refusal, never an authorization), and (c) `row.processEpoch == serveEpoch` (a superseded predecessor after a restart is refused). An absent or TTL-expunged row reads ABSENT and refuses fail-closed. This binding is ALIAS-LEVEL, not incarnation-level: the gate is keyed by the PERSISTED `instanceId` and its row carries no lifecycle uid, so a same-principal predecessor presenting the current epoch still passes — binding the publishing incarnation would require a gate-row schema change. The four-outcome idempotence table answers in operator vocabulary (already-retired = success; the same stable opId resumes; a foreign operation refuses naming it; a stale incarnation refuses naming the current one), and every refusal is a COMPLETE no-op stated as such | subscribe `ep.one.auth.>` QUEUE-QUALIFIED (queue group `auth`; §13.9 forbids a plain subscribe of the class rail) + publish `ep.reply.auth.<instanceId>.<epoch>.*.*.*.*` (REPLY PLANE ONLY: the request and reply planes are disjoint in the grammar, so the listener credential cannot express a request subject at all — the self-forge is closed structurally, not by carving replies out of a shared subtree) (replies ONLY: the handler only ever responds on the DERIVED reply subject, and the reply plane cannot express a request subject at all, so a request is unpublishable by the listener credential, closing the self-forge where a compromised listener publishes a request as an authorized caller and passes its own subject-derived check) + `$JS.API.INFO` + the ONE serve-issuance-gate read row + its connection-scoped inbox; NO store writes, NO consumer authority, NO scanner/plane reach — every executing right stays with the plane's own registry and retirement deps (the drain rides the plane's ONE sealed records scanner) | mediated **NOT YET A CONFORMING ENDPOINT (Cotal #399): this rail carries the endpoint SUBJECTS only.** It does not register a `svc.<endpoint>.<instanceId>` service record, does not serve the reserved `describe`, has no contract/cluster artifact, and still exchanges the pre-v0.4 `{op,args}` / `{ok,data,error}` bodies this document states are DELETED. **A generic endpoint client can therefore neither discover nor invoke this command**; only a caller that already knows the subject shape and speaks the legacy body can reach it. The acceptance-path hole is closed (the request carries an `id`, the reply echoes it, a non-echoing reply is refused); the conformance gap is tracked at #399. |
| Retirement requester (per-despawn, §13.2) | an EPHEMERAL one-shot credential the space manager mints per despawn (`retirement-requester` profile, five-minute window): request + reply ONLY, for exactly ITS OWN caller triple AND exactly ONE grant-pinned TARGET incarnation (the `handle` triple is literal in the grant; the per-request nonce is the only wildcard token), so a leaked requester cannot be re-aimed at another lifecycle. The manager derives a STABLE opId from the retiring lifecycleUid, so a despawn retry, a same-name-spawn nudge, and the auth service's boot resume all drive the SAME operation. The requester holds no executing right — a leaked credential can only ask the rail to retire a lifecycle, and the rail's fresh serve-issuance-gate check (including the principal cross-check) + idempotence table bound what that ask can do | publish exactly `ep.one.auth.retire-lifecycle.handle.<tO>.<tA>.<tUid>.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.*` (its minting manager's own caller triple, its one target) + subscribe its own reply-plane filter `ep.reply.*.*.*.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.*` and its connection-scoped inbox; nothing else | mediated **`handle`-MODE DEVIATION, stated explicitly (Cotal #399): this row is NOT redemption-minted.** `handle` is normatively redemption-minted only - its triple pinned at redemption from an issuer-signed capability artifact, carrying attenuation, conferral through the trusted auth service, and ledgered `sourceChain` lineage. **This path has NO issuer-signed artifact, NO redemption step and NO `sourceChain`**: the row is built directly from the minting manager's own coordinates under root authority. `handle` is used because it is the ONLY mode with arity 3 (every other mode resolves against the CURRENT mapping, the wrong semantics for retiring a NAMED incarnation), and the reader-facing invariant - the validator re-checks only currency - IS honoured by the serve-time mapping check. What is absent is delegation lineage and artifact revocation; there is no independent issuer/holder boundary on this one-shot path whose revocation would change this requester's authority. Genuine redemption-shaping is tracked at #399. |
| Governance head (registration linearization) | the provisioner-registration principal | the **unsplit** governance head `$KV.cotal_records_<space>.govern.<endpoint>` (§13.7): it reads the head FRESH under the frozen registration gate (a FENCING read, read service above: leader-served `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.KV_cotal_records_<space>` last-by-subject on the head key, never the follower-served `DIRECT.GET` the records bucket would allow) and is the head's ONLY writer (slot-take CAS in phase 1, promote CAS after the spec publish); the SAME principal holds the write on `$KV.cotal_records_<space>.policy.<endpoint>.>` (each immutable policy version is published exactly once, before the stage CAS that names it). The immutability of a policy version is a TRUSTED-WRITER INVARIANT, not a broker-enforced subtraction: KV create/update/delete all publish to the one `$KV.…policy.<endpoint>.<digest>` subject, and NATS subject permissions cannot distinguish the create-CAS header or the `KV-Operation` header, so a subject grant cannot forbid an overwrite or DEL. The invariant is upheld by the writer's create-only CAS plus every reader's SELF-CERTIFICATION (§13.7: the value must digest to the key), so a changed-byte overwrite is REFUSED on read; the residual, confined to this prefix, is that a buggy or compromised provisioner could still DEL or same-byte-overwrite an enforced version and (history 1) destroy its availability, at which point admission pauses fail-closed rather than admitting under a lost policy. No agent, endpoint, observer, admin, or host profile holds any grant. The head is NEVER-DELETED (the `lifecycle`-head discipline): no grant permits DEL/PURGE on `govern.>`; a reader treats only TRUE ABSENCE as a virgin head, and a deletion marker refuses loudly as corruption (§13.12 retention floor), never as absence | mediated |

Terminal pool cleanup settlement is lease-fenced across the two profiles above: the executor
CASes the item's lease (or observes the winning settled lease), publishes/observes the exact
lease-derived `wrk` terminal, and only then does the cleaner, after re-reading and
codec-validating that terminal, ACK the delivery. A `wrk` create that bypasses the lease CAS is
non-conformant: it can contradict a racing commit.

An `eff` completion fact `epf.<endpoint>.eff.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.<id>` is a CLOSED two-member
union carrying a REQUIRED `outcome` discriminant on EVERY member (the goal union's `state`
bar, applied to effects: a member is never structurally assignable to the other, and every
reader is forced to read the outcome). The RAN member is
`{ v: 1, id, fingerprint, caller, sourceSeq, ts, outcome: "ran" }`; the RETIREMENT-CANCELLED
member is `outcome: "cancelled"` plus exactly `cancelled: { opId, target }` — the same
identity spine, plus the binding to the retiring target's lifecycle and the retirement
operation that cancelled it. A fact missing the discriminant, or claiming one outcome while
carrying the other's fields, refuses. A reader that sees `cancelled` KNOWS the effect did not run; the member is never
a forged success. Both members' caller triple and `id` are bound by the subject, and their
`fingerprint` and `sourceSeq` MUST equal the accepted decision's. The cancelled member may be
written ONLY for an acceptance whose own `target` names the retiring lifecycle (a retirement
never cancels a foreign target's work), publishes CREATE-ONLY on the SAME subject the real
marker would use — so first-terminal-wins is structural: a racing real completion that lands
first wins and the cancel loses its create harmlessly, and vice versa — and is produced by
the drain's per-op canceller profile (§13.9). An ACTION needs no new member: the `goal….result`
union already carries the first-class `cancelled` outcome state, and a retirement-cancelled
goal terminalizes through it with the same acceptance-fingerprint binding and the retirement
attribution in its digest-bound payload (`data.cancelledBy = { opId, target }`). An
effects-route drain compares the PARSED fact against the acceptance and treats EITHER bound
member as established; an action's drain instead requires the parsed `goal….result` fact whose
`fingerprint` matches the acceptance. Subject presence alone never proves completion: a bare,
malformed, or mismatched fact refuses the drain loud (§13.8).

Raw `STREAM.MSG.GET` and `CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT` authority carries a caller-selected reply subject.
For every trusted profile holding those APIs, D32 includes confused-deputy response injection:
compromise can direct fetched API/message bytes onto a foreign subject even though its
connection-scoped inbox prevents subscribing there. This is injection, not foreign read access,
and requires a future fixed-destination mediation boundary to remove.

Deletes beyond these rows: only the lifecycle-keyed deprovisioner (exact names, §13.1) and
stream retention.

A **mediated** row means the raw storage grant is held only by a narrowly scoped writer
principal (per endpoint, never a universal writer), with authenticated caller binding,
idempotent request semantics, and bounded failure/backpressure; CAS headers, fingerprint
rules, schema validity, and digest-correct bytes are *enforced* there. A **direct** row means
the broker guarantees writer/key containment only, and the row **explicitly downgrades**
CAS/schema/header/byte correctness to a conforming-client guarantee; readers of direct-row
state fail loud on invalid content. No profile (agent, observer, admin, host) holds generic
`$JS.API.>`/`$KV.>`/`$O.>` authority over control-surface state, for the contract store that
means the REAL subjects and APIs: **write** on `cotal.<space>.epc.>` belongs
to the contract publisher alone (create-only per digest subject); **read** is the
subject-scoped last-by-subject Direct Get of the reader row above, never a body-selected
form and never a consumer, because there is nothing to replay: one message per digest
subject IS the store, with verify-on-read as the tamper
boundary; and the **stream-management surface** of `EPC_<space>`
(`$JS.API.STREAM.{UPDATE,DELETE,PURGE,MSG.DELETE}.…`) is held by NO profile, publisher
included, stream lifecycle belongs to space setup under operator provisioning authority
only, which is what "immutable once published" rests on (a `$OBJ.>` deny matches no NATS
subject and audits nothing).
The matrix is re-audited mechanically (decoded-credential fixture + live positive/negative
probes, with predicates over the real `$O.`/`$JS.API` subject forms) at every phase that
adds a resource or changes ownership.

**Writer table (core kinds, mediation decided, D7: authoritative CAS/schema record writes
are mediated by separately scoped spec/status writer principals; an endpoint holds no raw
overwrite grant on its own record keys).** `svc`, spec: the provisioner/registration path,
**mediated** (CAS + schema enforced at registration); status: the owning instance's commit
path, **mediated** with **epoch currency enforced at the writer**: the writing epoch is
read from the broker-authenticated `epr` ingress subject (§13.2, the instance's serve
credential pins the epoch token there, so a stale process CANNOT claim the successor's
epoch: the value is attested by the grant, never by payload), and the writer validates it
against a FRESH read of the authoritative lifecycle mapping's `processEpoch`,
rejecting a non-current epoch (`expired`), monotonicity against the stored status epoch
alone is NOT sufficient, because between the takeover CAS (mapping N→N+1) and the completed
revoke/evict barrier the superseded N would still equal the stored status epoch and pass a
below-stored check, and additionally rejects a below-stored epoch (`conflict`). The record
key is restart-stable and
cannot carry the epoch (§13.1), so this epoch-pinned-ingress-plus-fresh-equality mediation
is the record's only stale-writer fence.
`signer`, spec+status: the space operator's registry tooling as the scoped writer
principal, **mediated**. `handle`; keys are **issuer-namespaced**,
`handle.<issuerKeyId>.<id>`, so two issuers can never collide or cross-revoke; spec: the
issuer through the record-writer seam, create-only; status/revocation: issuer or space
operator, **mediated and monotonic** (revoked never un-revokes; the signature stays the
content authority; mediation enforces key grammar, CAS, and schema). `contracts` index, the instance, **direct** (explicitly advisory and
non-authoritative; `describe` is authoritative; readers fail loud on invalid state).
`goal`/`cp` projections, status: the owning instance's commit path, **mediated**. Lifecycle
mapping records (§13.1), the minting manager's commit path, **mediated**, CAS-only. The
`govern` head (§13.7), the provisioner-registration principal, **mediated**, CAS-only (the
matrix row above).
Canonical acceptance, work-pool enqueue, lease state, and contract-artifact publication,
**mediated** per the matrix above.

**Trait seam.** Core owns the fail-closed pre-effect verification interfaces (guard call,
priced-proof verification, governed-attachment verification); policy engines, token formats,
and payment rails remain extensions behind those seams.

### 13.10 Receipts and signing trust anchors

**Receipts.** A receipt binds a request to its outcome, signed and non-repudiable, for
metering, disputes, and pipeline causality; payment semantics stay opaque to core.

`Receipt` = `{ v: 1, requestId, sourceSeq (the accepted submission's sequence, the
execution identity its subject carries, §13.2), space, endpoint, command, instance: { id, instanceId, epoch },
caller: { id, lifecycleUid }, schemaDigests: { input, output }, argsDigest, outcome: { ok,
code? }, resultDigest?, ts, signer: { keyId }, sig }`, canonical JSON, Ed25519-signed
(`space` per the unconditional artifact rule below).
Lifecycle and epoch are recorded as **evidence**, never redemption authority. A command
carrying `ai.cotal.priced` MUST verify an independently verifiable payment proof in the
`auth` slot before effect (never a bare "settled" assertion) and emit a receipt fact
(`epf….receipt.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<id>.<sourceSeq>`, the caller- and
execution-scoped subject of §13.2; receipts are create-only per subject). A priced command
is therefore journal-class: its receipt derives its identity from the accepted submission's
decision fact and its outcome from the committed terminal, never from emitter-supplied
parameters, so a command with no acceptance fact has no receipt to emit; a conforming
implementation refuses to serve `ai.cotal.priced` on an ephemeral command (an
admission-time refusal at serve construction, never a first-request surprise). Receipt
retention: default 90 d, ≥ the idempotency horizon (outcome-stated by the §13.12 retention
floor).
Verification: signature against the anchor registry + digest recomputation; forged or
request-mismatched receipts fail loud. Receipts MAY be emitted for unpriced commands.

**Trust anchors.** One per-space registry covers every signed artifact of this section,
authorization slots, capability handles, checkpoint resumes, trait definitions and
attachments, session grants, receipts. Anchors are `signer.<keyId>` records: spec =
`{ keyId, publicKey (Ed25519), owner (the principal or reverse-DNS domain the key belongs
to), roles ⊆ [handles, traits, receipts, resume, sessions, authz-slots, obligations,
payments], scope: per-role structured ceilings, for a `handles`-role key the **full grant
dimensions**, in the handle-grant shape itself: the endpoints/domains, and per entry the
maximal commands, authorization modes, target patterns, instance ids, and read subtrees the
key may issue for (a handles- or receipts-role key without a dimension ceiling has that
dimension closed, not open); for other roles the endpoints/domains it may attest for,
validFrom, validTo }`, status = revocation. `issuer-authority` is defined by exactly this
record: a verifier resolves the artifact's keyId FRESH at verification and enforces the role
AND its scope under the §13.6 containment order (`handle.grants ⊆ anchor.scope`), a
handles-role key scoped to `com.acme.>` cannot issue for `manager`, a receipts-role key
scoped to one endpoint cannot attest as another, and a handles-role key whose scope names no
`handle`-mode targets cannot issue actor-pinned grants. Verification (fail closed): resolve the key,
reject unknown keys, out-of-window use, role mismatch, or revocation (immediate for new
verifications; effected work is not retroactively unwound). Rotation registers a successor
and closes the predecessor's window; overlap is permitted for handoff. Third-party trait
authorities register under their reverse-DNS domain claim. Trust roots never merge across
spaces.

**Signature encoding (normative, D28).** For every signed artifact: the signature input is
the UTF-8 bytes of the RFC 8785 canonical JSON of the artifact **with its `sig` field
absent**; the signature is Ed25519 (nkeys); `sig` carries it base64url-encoded (unpadded).
Verification recomputes the canonical form, resolves `signer.keyId`/`issuer.keyId` in the
anchor registry, and fails closed on any mismatch.

**Replay and claims matrix (normative, per artifact type).** Every row below additionally
and unconditionally requires `space`, the signing `keyId` (`issuer`/`signer` per shape), and
`sig` (the §13.10 encoding): an artifact missing any of the three is invalid before its
replay rule is ever consulted, and each artifact type is a discriminated schema, a verifier
dispatches on the type, never duck-types the claims.

| Artifact | Required claims | Replay rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capability handle | id, space, issuer, holder (principal+UID), structured grants, iat, exp (nbf, parentDigest, epoch as applicable) | reusable within TTL, holder-bound; revocable if sturdy |
| Checkpoint resume | checkpoint token, goal id, holder (principal+UID), iat, exp, nonce | **one-use** (journaled by create-only CAS); duplicate = `conflict` |
| Session grant | sessionId, subjects, holder (principal+UID+processEpoch), serving instance+epoch, window, iat, exp, nonce | **one-use** redemption (holder epoch fresh-checked), then live; dies with either side's epoch |
| Guard obligation | goal/request id, attenuations, iat, exp | bound to its goal/request; reusable within it |
| Payment proof | per the priced contract's declared policy | default one-use per request id |
| Trait attachment | endpoint, command, contractDigest, traitUrn, value, signer, ts | revision-bound evidence; replaced only by an authorized contract revision |
| Receipt | per §13.10 shape (ts, signer; no exp/nonce) | evidence, never authority; replay-irrelevant |

Every verifier rejects out-of-window use (where `exp` applies), wrong-holder presentation,
and unknown/revoked keys.

### 13.11 The hard cut

This section is an intentional hard cut on the pre-1.0 line per §11. The version marker is
the grammar itself: the `ep`/`epe`/`epf`/`epj`/`ept`/`epw`/`eps` subject kinds and the
versioned envelope are disjoint from every v0.3 control subject and shape, and the old rails
are removed, subjects, envelopes,
handlers, credential grants, minting paths. No compatibility adapter, dual serving, or
translation window exists. A credential minted before the cut can publish only into dead v0
subjects: nothing subscribes them, no post-cut handler is reachable from them, no trusted
reply can be elicited (a pre-cut grant matches no endpoint-surface subject by construction,
verified adversarially with captured pre-cut credentials from every old profile). The one
structural exception is the pre-cut `admin` profile, whose space-wide `P.>` subscribe
predates and therefore MATCHES the new rails: **admin credentials MUST be re-minted at the
cutover** to the post-cut admin shape (Appendix B: messaging-plane subjects only, no
`ep*`/`eps`/`epc` subscribe), and the pre-cut admin credential is revoked with the cut;
the hard-cut guarantee is not honest without it. The wire
`protocolVersion` (§6, §11) targets `0.4` at the completion of this revision's migration, per
the §11 convention that the advertised version is the migration's normative target, and a
v0.4-conformant participant MUST advertise it (the optional-field era ends at the marker
boundary); `1.0` is a separate, later stability declaration (§11).

### 13.12 NATS + JetStream binding

**Broker floor.** The control surface REQUIRES NATS server ≥ 2.12 (message schedules, atomic
create-CAS, counters) AND a `max_control_line` large enough for the deployment's
maximum-capability CONNECT line. The two floors are checked at the tier that can see them:

- **Clients** check the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail loud below 2.12 or
  when schedules are unavailable (including the offline-assets downgrade mode). The
  control-line limit is NOT discoverable pre-auth; an oversized CONNECT is silently dropped
  and looks like a network fault, so a client's obligation is bounded reconnect attempts
  plus the named diagnostic on a repeated pre-auth drop ("CONNECT may exceed the broker's
  max_control_line; have the operator verify it"), never an infinite retry loop.
- **Operator tooling** (doctor/setup) asserts the cause before any credential is minted:
  read `max_control_line` over the system account (`$SYS.REQ.SERVER.PING.VARZ`) from
  **every server of the cluster the credential may connect to**; the ping is fanned out,
  the response set is checked complete against the expected server count, and a partial
  response set is a FAILED assertion, never a pass, and require, on each server,
  `max_control_line ≥ (largest encoded CONNECT line of the §13.9 fixture set) + margin`.
  The fixtures are **byte-reproducible** (concrete maximum-length identities, the full
  grant set at the policy ceiling, the maximum-capability agent credential and the
  maximum-command serve credential, the encoded credentials, the resulting CONNECT
  lengths), so the floor is a measured quantity; the reference deployment's configured value
  is 65536; a derived number, not an assertion. The 16 KiB policy gate remains a distinct
  mint-time cap on credential authority, refused loudly at minting. The same assertion pass
  checks `max_payload ≥` the largest serialized **bounded decision fact** fixture (the
  maximum `RejectionFact`/`QuarantineFact` under the token and detail bounds, §13.4) AND
  `max_payload ≥` the 256 KiB contract-artifact document bound plus envelope margin
  (§13.7; a contract artifact is one message on its digest subject), so
  "the rejection fact always fits by construction" and "an artifact is a single message"
  are measured floors, not assumptions.

No sweeper fallback exists. Only 2.12 schedule semantics are assumed (same-subject
replacement; NOT the 2.14 stop-plus-publish path).

Per-space resources, created at space setup (`STREAM.CREATE` remains denied to agents):

| Resource | Captures / holds | Retention notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EPJ_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.epj.>` (submissions, untrusted) | Limits; **native dedupe not relied upon**; submitters never set `Nats-Msg-Id` (§13.4; stream-wide header dedupe is a cross-caller suppression vector on a shared untrusted stream). A zero duplicate window is NOT server-accepted (`0` normalizes to the 120 s default; the minimum is 100 ms), so the config sets the server minimum and the guarantee is the header rule: a hostile header suppresses only another non-conformant header-bearing write; retention ≥ recovery/redelivery lag |
| `EPF_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.epf.>` (canonical facts) | Limits; acceptance via create-only CAS (`Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence: 0`); `allow_direct=true` (NON-fencing subject-confined reads only: every §13.9 matrix fact read is FENCING and leader-served `STREAM.MSG.GET`, §13.9 read service); retention ≥ horizons, outcome-stated by the retention floor below |
| `EPE_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.epe.>` (events, progress) | Limits; space policy |
| `EPT_REQ_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.ept.*.*.*.*.schedule` (instance schedule REQUESTS, §13.2) | Limits; message schedules **DISABLED**; client-set scheduling headers are inert bytes here; retention ≥ writer recovery lag |
| `EPR_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.epr.>` (record-write ingress, §13.2) | Limits; epoch-pinned publish grants (§13.9); consumed only by the record writer; retention ≥ writer recovery lag |
| `EPT_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.ept.*.*.*.*.armed` + `….fire` (authoritative schedules + fires, §13.2) | `AllowMsgSchedules`; only the timer writer publishes `.armed` (§13.9); each schedule targets its sibling `.fire` subject (ADR-51 forbids target = publish subject); retention ≥ max deadline + margin |
| `EPW_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.epw.>` (work pools; one item per subject, §13.2) | WorkQueue; provisioner-pre-created non-overlapping exact-filter per-pool consumers (§13.9) with **`max_deliver=-1` pinned** (a finite delivery ceiling strands exhausted items outside `num_pending`/`num_ack_pending` and falsifies the §13.6 admission occupancy; the occupancy reader re-checks the pin at every read because MaxDeliver is editable post-create); **`allow_direct=false`**: EPW has NO non-fencing subject-confined reader (pool workers drain the WorkQueue via `CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT`, never a subject read), and its ONLY subject read is the reconciliation probe, which is FENCING and MUST be leader-served `STREAM.MSG.GET` (§13.9 read service; an acked item leaves the WorkQueue, an in-flight one remains readable, which is exactly the §13.6 predicate, and a stale follower miss would re-arm settled work). Disabling Direct Get on EPW makes that leader-served requirement STRUCTURAL: no reader (including virtual-endpoint activation reconciliation, §13.6) can take the follower path even by mistake. This differs from EPF, which keeps `allow_direct=true` because it DOES have non-fencing subject readers (the §13.9 last-by-subject fact reads); EPF's fencing CAS-winner read opts into the leader by caller choice |
| `WFJ_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.wfj.*` (the workflow STEP JOURNAL, §14.4: **one subject per RUN, `cotal.<space>.wfj.<runId>`, not one per entry**) | Limits, file storage, **no `max_age`** and no finite count/byte limit that evicts (an evicted prefix is not a shorter journal, it is a run that re-performs effects it already performed, and a run that sleeps for a month resumes by re-reading it; retirement is by subject purge, deliberately); **`allow_direct=false`** (a resume must read its own predecessor's last appends, and Direct Get is follower-servable, so a stale miss there reads as "this step never ran"). Deliberately outside the `ep*` plane letters: the journal is a runtime layer over the control surface, not part of the endpoint contract. Every append is fenced by `Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence` on the run's own subject (§14.4); a run's driver holds publish on exactly its own run's subject plus a per-takeover replay durable filtered to it, and there is no space-wide `wfj.>` publish grant |
| (sessions: core-only, no stream) | `cotal.<space>.eps.>` | never captured; bounded in-memory window |
| `cotal_records_<space>` KV | records: the §13.7 core-kind key grammars (`svc`, `signer`, `handle`, `contracts`, `goal`, `cp`, `lease`, `lifecycle`, `govern`, `uid`, `policy`, `oblig`, and the §14 kinds `run`, `answer`, `notice`, `migration`) | per-key CAS; `.spec`/`.status`-split keys EXCEPT the unsplit atomic keys `lifecycle.<owner>.<actor>`, `govern.<endpoint>`, `uid.<lifecycleUid>`, `policy.<endpoint>.<digest-hex>`, and `oblig.>` (§13.1/§13.7/§13.8/§13.9); `allow_direct=true`, but the heads and every fencing read are leader-served `STREAM.MSG.GET` (§13.9 read service). **No age retention on authority keys:** `lifecycle` heads, `govern`, `uid` reservations, `policy` versions, and `oblig` rows are NEVER-DELETED (no grant permits DEL/PURGE; an age-evicted reservation would reopen UID reuse, an evicted obligation would orphan accepted work); a deletion marker on any of them refuses loudly as corruption, never as absence. **Shape is proved at bind, not assumed:** the stream MUST be primary (never a mirror/sourced copy) and MUST carry no bucket-wide silent-eviction limit (no `max_age`, no finite `max_msgs`/`max_bytes`: under `DiscardOld` a finite global limit evicts a prior authority key's latest row the moment an unrelated key is written); every trusted consumer of this store (the minting authority, the mapping reader, the mediator) verifies exactly this via `STREAM.INFO` when it binds and refuses to serve otherwise |
| `cotal_auth_<space>` KV | the credential ledger (`cred.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` + issuance gates `gate.<lifecycleUid>` + the disjoint endpoint families `epgate.<endpoint>.<instanceId>` / `epcred.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<credentialId>` + the staging family `stage.>` + source gates `srcgate.<issuerKeyId>.<id>` + lineage index `bysrc.…`, §13.1) + session ledger (`session.<sessionId>`, §13.6) | trusted auth path ONLY; no agent, endpoint, observer, admin, or host profile holds any grant (§13.9 matrix); **`allow_direct=false`** (every fence is a leader-served revision-pinned CAS write; Direct Get's follower/mirror reads would defeat read-your-writes, §13.1); CAS + monotonic states. **No bucket-wide age retention:** `gate.`, `epgate.`, `srcgate.`, and `session.` authority keys persist until their lifecycle/handle/session is explicitly terminal (an age-evicted `open` gate would silently reopen minting, or drop a `frozen`/`retired` fence); only `cred.`/`epcred.`/`bysrc.` rows carry a per-key TTL bounded by the credential TTL (NATS per-key message TTL, ≥ 2.12), never a bucket MaxAge; `stage.` rows follow their operation's retention, never a ledger row's. **Shape is proved at bind** (the records-store rule above, plus `allow_direct=false`): primary, un-mirrored, no bucket `max_age`, no finite `max_msgs`/`max_bytes`; the trusted auth path verifies this via `STREAM.INFO` when it binds and refuses to serve otherwise |
| `EPC_<space>` stream | `cotal.<space>.epc.>` (content-addressed contract artifacts, one per digest subject, §13.7) | Limits, no age eviction (artifacts are permanent); create-only mediated publication (`Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence: 0`); `allow_direct=true` (the subject-scoped last-by-subject read IS the fetch path; non-fencing, verify-on-read); permanence is BROKER-ENFORCED: `deny_delete=true, deny_purge=true` (the broker rejects the message-delete and purge APIs even from a stream-API-holding principal). Permanence is the COMBINATION of these flags, the retention floor's no-early-removal rule (below: the flags alone stop delete/purge but not age eviction or a whole-stream teardown), verify-on-read pinning WHAT a subject carries, and the stream-management surface held by no profile (§13.9); no single flag makes deletion structurally impossible |

**Retention floor (one-use-identity facts).** A stream or bucket whose messages carry
one-use identity, that is decision facts realizing the §13.4 idempotency horizon, goal
terminal facts and tombstones (§13.6), receipt facts (§13.10), and the never-deleted
authority heads (`lifecycle`, `govern`, the auth-bucket gates), MUST retain every protected
message until its governing horizon, stated by OUTCOME: NO removal cause may drop a
protected fact early. That forbids not only age eviction below the horizon but every
conforming alternative that erases it while `MaxAge` still passes: a finite
`MaxMsgs`/`MaxBytes`/`MaxMsgsPerSubject` with `DiscardOld`, a per-message TTL,
rollup/compaction, or a retention-policy change; for these families finite count/byte
limits MUST fail loud or `DiscardNew` rather than evict protected history, and message TTL
and rollup MUST be disabled on protected subjects (a per-key TTL is permitted only on
non-protected keys, e.g. the auth bucket's `cred.`/`bysrc.` index rows above, never on a
protected fact, head, or gate). NO principal, including operator, setup, and system tooling,
not only §13.9 profiles, may `MSG.DELETE`/`PURGE`, `STREAM.DELETE`, or issue a
`STREAM.UPDATE` that weakens any of these limits; the never-deleted heads and gates carry
an UNBOUNDED horizon. A KV writer MUST NOT publish a DEL/PURGE marker for a never-deleted
key, and a reader that encounters one treats it as corruption, never as absence. (Root can
always destroy a broker; such an act is explicitly non-conformant, not outside this
clause.) `CONSUMER.DELETE` is distinct and permitted: it removes a reader cursor and can
never mutate stored facts. Concretely: `EPF_<space>` retention ≥ max(idempotency horizon,
result retention, receipt retention), because the acceptance fact is the durable
reconstruction source for receipts, while the raw submission stream is age-evicted by
design.

Claim pools are pull consumers on `EPW` with `AckExplicit`, held **only by the pool's owning
endpoint** (§13.5): `ack_wait` is the broker's redelivery-to-owner timer and nothing more;
the authoritative lease token and deadline live in the owner's lease record, never in the
item value (stored bytes are work identity and input only), and the owner acks only after
the committed terminal state. Filtered replay of events/facts uses pinned single-filter
consumer creates (the CHAT-history containment mechanism, §8/§9). Timer scheduling is
**mediated** (§13.2, §13.9): instances publish only `.schedule` REQUESTS into the
schedules-disabled `EPT_REQ` stream, where a client-set `Nats-Schedule-Target` (or any
scheduling header) is inert bytes and the timer writer rejects a request carrying one, this
closes the ADR-51 confused deputy, in which a direct publisher confined only to "some
subject the schedules stream captures" could target ANOTHER instance's `.schedule` (installing
or replacing its schedule state, since schedule headers are copied to the target verbatim) or
its `.fire`. The timer writer alone publishes the authoritative schedule on `.armed`, with
`Nats-Schedule-Target` = the sibling `….fire` subject derived from the authenticated request
subject's own tokens; and **fire handling is the trusted seam** behind it, a `.fire`
consumer acts only on a fired message matching a current authoritative
schedule it owns (`timerId` + generation + deadline, §13.2) AND whose broker-authored
scheduler-origin header (`Nats-Scheduler`, the schedule's subject, set by the server on
fire) equals its own exact sibling `.armed` subject, discarding anything else as
forged. Replacement is the writer's same-subject publish on `.armed` (server rollup); fired
messages appear on `.fire` carrying `(timerId, generation)`.

### 13.13 Plane ownership (the sealed-scanner claim)

At most ONE authority plane per space may hold the sealed scanners (§13.9's seventh-round
seal). The scanners' serialization is process-local, so two same-space auth processes would
interleave the literal enumeration consumers' critical sections and return PARTIAL
enumerations: a drain declares quiescence over undrained obligations and the retirement
frontiers close over live work. The exclusion is broker-visible, not host-local:

- **The claim row.** One exact, never-deleted auth-KV key (`plane`, subject
  `$KV.cotal_auth_<space>.plane`) holds `{ v, generation, claimId, state: held | released,
  ledger, records, openedAt }`, where `ledger`/`records` are the two ownership-bearing sealed
  scanner connections' broker identities `(serverId, cid, userNkey)`. The barrier profile is
  the row's SOLE writer, at exact arity (never `plane.>`); reads are leader-served. The
  barrier's own identity is deliberately NOT in the row: barrier liveness is irrelevant to the
  literal consumers and could only falsely block a reclaim.
- **Open order.** Ensure stores; open BOTH candidate scanner connections NON-RECONNECTING (the
  tuples must be stable and disappearance must be final) and keep them INERT (no scan
  capability exists or escapes); take the claim by broker-atomic create (virgin key) or
  revision-CAS (a `released` row, or a `held` row proven dead as below). Only the WINNER
  constructs the branded scanners; a loser closes both candidates and refuses with
  operator-legible copy. The brief dual connected-credential window before the CAS is inside
  the trusted signing-seed residual; there is no dual SCAN authority because the capability
  does not exist before the win.
- **Plane credentials.** The two plane-owned scanner connections authenticate with
  NON-EXPIRING user JWTs, for exactly these two connections and no other profile: an expiring
  credential would have the broker hard-disconnect at expiry, and a renewal cannot be
  presented without the reconnect the non-reconnecting shape forbids — an expiry would fence
  the plane on a timer. The credentials never leave process memory, and the account signing
  seed co-resident in the same memory is strictly stronger authority, so the marginal
  exposure is the existing trusted-process residual class; revocation remains service-stop +
  seed rotation. Every other authority credential keeps the short-expiry + in-process-renewal
  boundary.
- **Reclaim is liveness-only.** A `held` row is reclaimed only when BOTH claimed tuples are
  conclusively ABSENT under a COMPLETE connection sweep, adjudicated by the delivery daemon's
  read-only oracle over the privileged delivery-admin rail (the auth process holds no `$SYS`;
  the D5 rail split). The closed oracle verb takes exactly the two claimed tuples and returns
  two bound verdicts (`live | gone | unknown`) plus sweep completeness, echoing the queried
  identities; any live, unknown, incomplete, malformed, or foreign-echo answer REFUSES the
  takeover (at most one plane: dual-refuse is safe, dual-proceed is not). There is NO TTL, NO
  heartbeat, and NO "did the last sealed scan finish" bit: a mid-scan crash drops the
  non-reconnecting connections, a complete sweep proves them gone, and the successor's
  fail-closed pre-clean (§13.9) makes its full re-scan safe. A paused-but-live process still
  holds its TCP connections and therefore still holds the plane (no pause hazard).
- **The single-server proof.** Connection absence alone cannot distinguish a RESTARTED
  claimed server (`server_id` is per-broker-run; genuinely gone, and requiring its reply
  forever would turn every whole-stack crash into a permanent reclaim wedge) from a
  PARTITIONED one (live, unreachable; treating its absence as death authorizes a split-brain
  steal). A `gone` verdict is therefore valid ONLY under the single-nats-server-process
  boundary, proven per observation from the responding server's OWN topology declaration in
  the `$SYS` reply envelope — never inferred from which servers happened to reply: every
  reply must declare NO cluster membership and exactly one distinct server may have replied.
  Any cluster self-report, multi-server observation, or reply without the declaration reads
  `unknown` and refuses. Only a SUCCESSFUL, well-formed page counts toward the sweep: a reply
  carrying an API error, a malformed or empty server envelope, a non-string cluster
  declaration, an envelope/data server-id mismatch, or a structurally incomplete data page
  poisons the whole observation (every verdict `unknown`). Each sweep's reply inbox carries a
  per-call collision-resistant nonce, so concurrent sweeps can never satisfy or falsely
  complete each other's rounds; and the auth plane closed-parses the oracle's result (exact
  keys at every level) before reasoning over it. NAMED residuals: a leafnode- or
  gateway-extended account is outside the cluster self-report, so such topologies are out of
  contract for the space's account; a backup restored onto a fresh broker can present a
  still-running foreign predecessor's `serverId` as dead. A clustered/multi-server deployment
  requires an authoritative server incarnation/roster authority in place of this proof.
- **Holding invariant.** The winner re-validates the claim (state `held`, its `claimId`, its
  `generation`, AND both pinned scanner tuples — a row rewrite preserving the identifiers but
  swapping a tuple is a lost claim, never "still ours") BEFORE every sealed scan (refuse to
  enumerate) and AFTER it (discard the enumeration), inside the serialized critical section.
  An owned scanner disconnect is a FENCING event, and the fence is FATAL to the WHOLE
  authority plane: scan exposure is invalidated immediately, the sibling closes, every
  authority operation (connect authorization, credential mint) refuses from that moment, and
  the service goes DOWN loud rather than serving from a half-dead plane a successor may be
  reclaiming; a still-live sibling correctly blocks a successor until it is closed or proven
  absent.
- **Clean close.** Scan-capable clients close FIRST, then the row CASes `held → released`
  (never released while either scanner can still act), then the barrier. A crash leaves
  `held`; the successor reclaims through the oracle. A `released` row is claimed without an
  oracle round.
- **Operator faces.** The three refusal states carry DISTINCT copy: a live peer ("stop the
  other auth process", with the space and connection identities), an inconclusive observation
  (fail-safe wait/retry wording that never says "stop the other process"; when the oracle rail
  is down it names the delivery daemon and the restart order), and a mid-life scanner death
  (a deliberate fail-closed stop naming the restart path). An unparseable claim row refuses
  loudly and is never overwritten automatically.
- **Host belt.** Launchers additionally claim an exclusive per-space pidfile, published
  ATOMICALLY and PRE-POPULATED: the claimant writes its pid to a unique temp inode, then
  publishes it as the slot with an atomic no-overwrite `link(2)` — no create-then-write window
  exists for a sibling to misread, and an empty slot is impossible to publish. A live holder
  is yielded to; a provably dead holder's slot — and an empty (pre-protocol crash shape) one —
  is reclaimed exactly once; unattributable content is never stolen. A cheap belt only, never
  the exclusion.

### 13.14 Conformance (control surface)

A conformant endpoint (v0.4) MUST:

1. Serve only under a credential whose serve grants match its registered name, stable
   instance id, and registered command set (publish-side grants pinned to the current
   epoch); register its service record before serving; advance the epoch by CAS on takeover
   and stop serving when superseded; a takeover is complete only after the §13.1 barrier
   (revoke + cluster-verified eviction of the superseded credential).
2. Answer `describe` authoritatively, intersected only against the trusted authorization view
   (or declared-public), failing closed when that view is unavailable.
3. Publish contract artifacts content-addressed and immutable; validate args/replies at
   runtime within the schema profile and budgets.
4. Reply only on the reply rail derived from the authenticated request subject; ignore
   payload/transport reply targets; let attribution ride the reply subject.
5. Enforce the envelope invariants (version/op/class/target/sender, catalog codes, monotonic
   attenuation); treat the subject, never the body, as the authorization boundary; resolve
   targets by `(alias, lifecycleUid)` against current mappings immediately before effect.
6. Route effects by delivery class; journaled effects only from canonical accepted facts
   through the mediated writer; fingerprint-bind ids first-wins; hold the declared horizons,
   retentions, and floors.
7. Validate every Cotal-owned commit through the mediated path (fencing token + unexpired
   lease + lifecycle + epoch as applicable); lose CAS loudly.
8. Implement advertised composites per §13.6: the single action vocabulary, authorization
   linearized at acceptance, one-use resumes, generation- and scheduler-origin-validated
   timers (a fire counts only against its own sibling `.armed`, §13.12) with durable
   reconciliation, fail-closed governed traits, bounded sessions.
9. Fail loud below the broker version floor (from the pre-auth INFO), with bounded
   reconnects and the named pre-auth-drop diagnostic (§13.12); the `max_control_line` floor
   is asserted by operator tooling (§13.12), never by the client, which cannot inspect it.
10. Connect successfully while presenting the normative maximum-capability credential
    fixture for its profile (§13.9), the only test that exercises the control-line bound.

A conformant caller (v0.4) MUST: hold a lifecycle-pinned credential and never present another
lifecycle's artifacts; choose ids/goalIds/nonces within the token grammar and the 1024-byte
subject bound and reuse ids only per the idempotency rules; declare `class` and
`replyExpected` and honor `contract-mismatch`/`conflict`; freeze scatter expectations from the
registry and classify partial results; verify digests of fetched artifacts and signed
artifacts against the anchor registry, failing closed; refuse to resolve a **describe descriptor**
whose `protocol.v` it does not implement (the marker rides the descriptor and the service record,
never the cluster document, which carries no `protocol`), and never automatically repeat a `write`
command (§13.7) — whatever `id` the re-issue carries — except on an outcome that proves
non-execution (§13.3).

## 14. Workflow runs (v0.5)

A **workflow run** is one execution of a program in the Cotal workflow language, hosted by a
**driver** (an endpoint, in the reference deployment the manager daemon) that performs the
program's effects against the mesh and records every one of them in a per-run **step journal**.
This section defines the run's wire footprint: the record it is described by, the stream its
journal travels on, the records its effects file, and the grants its driver holds. The
language, the journal entry, and the rules of resume, migration and fork are defined in
[`spec/cotal-lang.md`](spec/cotal-lang.md), which this section incorporates by reference: an
implementation of this section MUST implement that document.

### 14.1 Roles and identity

The **driver** is the one principal that executes a run: it validates and runs the program, calls
the effect handler, appends to the journal, and writes the run's records. It is hosted by an
endpoint, and every §14 key leads with that `<endpoint>` token so a per-endpoint enumeration and a
retirement drain (§13.1) both work by prefix. A **run id** (`<runId>`, an id token, §13.2) is minted
by the driver when the run starts, is never caller-supplied, and is **never reused**: re-running a
program from part of a run's history is a **fork**, and a fork is a new run under a new id whose
record names its parent (§14.3). A run has exactly one **authoritative appender** at a time; §14.4
is what makes that true.

### 14.2 The language and its version

Programs, values, primitives, the step key grammar, the input hash, the request id and the entry
schema are those of [`spec/cotal-lang.md`](spec/cotal-lang.md). The language carries a
**`languageVersion`**, bumped when a revision changes what a program means (its PRNG, a builtin,
numeric behaviour, walker scheduling) and deliberately not the package or wire version; a run pins
the version it started under (§14.3) and a resume under another version is refused
(`spec/cotal-lang.md` §8.4). A wire revision of this document therefore never invalidates an open
run, and a language revision never requires one here.

### 14.3 The run record

A run is described by the `run` record kind (§13.7): `run.<endpoint>.<runId>`, `.spec`/`.status`
split, mediated, written by the driver's commit path only.

- **Spec** (create-only, decided once): `{ v: 1, run, pins, createdAt }`. `pins` is
  the **resolved pin set** the run started under, `{ seed, startedAt, yieldEvery, stepBudget,
  effectCeiling, languageVersion }` (`spec/cotal-lang.md` §8.3): every one selects which effects run,
  so a resume MUST read them back and bind to them, and MUST refuse a caller value that differs.
  `startedAt` is the run's **logical epoch**, and a resuming host's own clock never moves a
  replayed program. The RESOLVED value is pinned, never the default: a default is a property of the
  interpreter, and the interpreter is the thing that may have changed between attempts. A spec that
  already exists MUST refuse a second start under the same id. A fork (`spec/cotal-lang.md` §11.3)
  is a new run with its own id and its own spec; this revision records NO lineage on the child (the
  spec has no parent field), so the fork's parent and cut are known only to the caller that asked
  for it. A later revision that adds a field to the spec half does so as its own binding revision,
  never by rewriting a spec that exists.
- **Status** (last-value-wins, CAS-written): `{ v: 1, observedSpecRevision, state, holder, epoch,
  fencingToken, journalHigh, at }`. `state` is one of `running`, `released`, `completed`, `failed`,
  and `released` and `failed` are different facts: a failed program has a result and the journal has
  it, a released run has none, because its driver stopped holding it (`spec/cotal-lang.md` §9.2,
  L5012). `holder`, `epoch` and `fencingToken` name the driver that holds the run and the lease
  (§13.6 work pool) it holds it under. `journalHigh` is the highest journal ordinal (§14.4) the run
  is KNOWN to have reached, written at each activation: it is the one anchor OUTSIDE the journal, so
  a replay whose last ordinal is below it has lost records from the journal's tail, which nothing
  inside the journal can see, and the driver MUST refuse to resume it. It covers truncation back
  past the last activation and no further; interior loss is the journal's own ordinal chain's.

### 14.4 The step journal on the wire

The journal of a run is carried by the per-space **`WFJ_<space>` stream** (§13.12) on **one subject
per run**, `cotal.<space>.wfj.<runId>`. An implementation MUST create the stream with limits
retention, file storage, no `max_age`, and `allow_direct=false`, and MUST NOT let any removal cause
evict a live run's prefix (§13.12 retention floor). Retirement of a run's journal is by subject
purge.

Every message on the subject is one **journal record**, JSON, one of two kinds. Both envelopes are
CLOSED: a reader MUST refuse a record that carries a field outside the shape below, and MUST refuse
an unknown `kind`, because a journal is replayed by whoever holds the run next and a field one
writer meant and another ignores is a divergence nothing would name:

- **activation**: `{ v: 1, kind: "activation", run, n, holder, fencingToken, epoch, replayedTo, at }`,
  the successor's first act, and the only record the runtime layer writes that is not a step.
- **step**: `{ v: 1, kind: "step", run, n, at, entry }`, where `entry` is a language journal entry
  (`spec/cotal-lang.md` §10.1) carried verbatim: the wire layer MUST NOT read inside it. A step is
  appended TWICE, once `pending` before its effect is dispatched and once settled after; a reader
  folds by the entry's key and the last record wins.

`n` is the record's **ordinal** in the run's journal, from 0, and a replay MUST require
`records[i].n === i`: the chain is the only check that sees a record removed from the middle of a
subject, since counting cannot and no anchor at the front can. A writer MUST stamp `run` with the run
the subject names; its grant covers exactly one subject (§14.6), which is what enforces it. A reader
SHOULD refuse a record whose `run` names another run; the reference reader relies on the grant and
does not re-check it.

**The activation barrier.** A run has exactly one authoritative appender at a time, and the STREAM
is the acceptor: every append MUST carry `Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence` for the run's own
subject, so a publish lands only if the subject is exactly where the publisher believed it was, and
there is no read-then-publish window because there is no read. Takeover is replay-then-activate:

1. The successor replays the run subject from the beginning, through a **per-takeover replay
   durable** it creates on the stream (`wfj_<runId>_<takeoverId>`, filtered to the run's subject,
   explicit ack, deliver-all) and deletes when done. `<takeoverId>` is an id token (§13.2) minted by
   whoever hands the driver its lease and its journal grant (§14.6), one per takeover of a run and
   never reused for that run; the driver does not choose it, because a consumer name is one subject
   token that no grant pattern covers in part, so it has to be known when the grant is minted. The
   last replayed record's stream sequence is the only authoritative head there is (`STREAM.INFO`'s
   `last_seq` is stream-wide, and its subject filter answers counts, not sequences).
2. Its first act is an **activation record** appended at that expected sequence, and it drives
   nothing before that record lands. Its authority is checked against the activation the journal
   already holds: a lower `fencingToken` is refused (stale lease); an equal token is refused unless
   `holder` AND `epoch` are the same (one process picking its own run back up); a higher token
   activates.
3. Once the activation lands the subject has advanced, so any append still in flight from the
   superseded driver carries a stale expectation and the server rejects it.

Two CAS refusals are two different states and MUST NOT be conflated. A refused ACTIVATION means "my
replay is stale": the successor has driven nothing, the records that beat it are more prefix, and it
MAY re-replay and activate again while it still holds the lease. A refused APPEND after an
activation that won means "someone else activated": that driver IS superseded, MUST stop, and MUST
NOT refresh the sequence and retry, because a retry at the new head is the defect the barrier
exists to prevent. A driver publishes one entry at a time from one serial queue per run and
advances its head only from each acknowledgement; once the bytes have gone out, any outcome without
one poisons the queue and nothing behind it reaches the wire (a record refused before it is sent,
for example one that cannot be serialized, fails only itself).

The journal is a language artifact, and its contents are decided by the language: a driver MUST
await the durable append of a `pending` entry before dispatching the effect it names, MUST settle
the entry from the handler's outcome, and MUST keep the settling append outside the handler's
failure domain, so a refused append is a durability failure (L5010) that stops the run and is never
recorded as the effect's failure (`spec/cotal-lang.md` §10.5). A cancelling scope's `cancel.issued`
records whether the driver has discharged the intent against the world; the record states the
intent and its discharge, and how a driver disposes of a losing arm's live work is a driver policy
this revision does not fix.

### 14.5 Answers, notices, migrations

Three record kinds carry the payloads a run's effects file (§13.7 for the grammar and the
sentences that defend each shape). Their derived id tokens all take one form: **the unpadded
base64url of the SHA-256 over the strict RFC 8785 canonical JSON of the named object, 43
characters**, which is an id token by construction. The reference implementation's canonicalizer is the one
§13.7's `*Digest` fields use.

- **`answer`**, `answer.<endpoint>.<token>.<answerId>`, atomic, create-only: `{ v: 1, token,
  answerId, value?, artifact?, by, at }`, filed BEFORE the checkpoint token is presented; the
  one-use settle fact (§13.6) then NAMES the id it accepted. For a checkpoint a run performed the
  `answerId` on a `resumed` settle is REQUIRED (§13.6 leaves it optional for other checkpoints): a
  run's handler reads the answer under the id the settle names, never by looking for "the answer to
  this token", and refuses a resumed settle that names none. `answerId` = the digest id of
  `{ token, by, value: value ?? null, artifact: artifact ?? null }`, so a retry of the same answer
  lands on the same key with the same bytes and two different answers race on the settle, which is
  what the settle is for. `by` is the answerer as the run's own authorization knows them, never the
  presenting principal (the driver, for every answer).
- **`notice`**, `notice.<endpoint>.<runId>.<addresseeId>.<noticeId>`, split: spec `{ v: 1, run,
  step, addressee, fact, at }` (create-only; `fact` is the language's bounded decision record and
  is checked against its bound BEFORE any record is written), status `{ v: 1, consumedAt, by,
  observedSpecRevision }` (create-only: the consumption is established once, by the turn that
  carried it). `addresseeId` = the digest id of `{ agent }` (the addressee's name); `noticeId` = the
  digest id of `{ requestId, addressee }`, where `requestId` is the `notify` step's request id, so
  one call to N agents files N notices and a re-run after a crash lands on the same ones. A driver
  that performs the addressee's turns MUST render an unconsumed notice ahead of its next turn and
  MUST NOT deliver it as a channel message. (The reference driver's turn plane is not durable in
  this revision, `spec/cotal-lang.md` §6.5, so no host performs that rendering today; the renderer
  and the consumed mark exist and are what a turn plane binds to.)
- **`migration`**, `migration.<endpoint>.<runId>.<migrationId>`, split: spec `{ v: 1, run,
  fromHash?, toHash, at, consumedThrough, orphans[], overrides[], actor }` (create-only), status
  `{ v: 1, appliedAt, by, observedSpecRevision }` (create-only). `migrationId` = the digest id of the
  spec without `at`, so a dry walk re-run after a crash files no second migration for one decision.
  `orphans[]` is `{ step, kind, verdict, code? }` per journal entry the new source no longer reaches,
  with the verdicts and refusals of `spec/cotal-lang.md` §11.2; `fromHash` is the caller's claim
  and is absent when not supplied, because the run record carries no program hash to verify it
  against. A migration never rewrites a journal.

### 14.6 Driver grants

Grants are DERIVED (§13.7, §13.9), and a run driver's are minted **per run and per takeover
attempt**, never per space:

- publish on exactly `cotal.<space>.wfj.<runId>`;
- create, bind (info, next, ack) and **delete** its own replay durable `wfj_<runId>_<takeoverId>`
  on `WFJ_<space>`, named per takeover because a durable remembers how far it delivered and a
  successor needs the prefix from the top, and because a consumer name is one subject token that no
  pattern covers in part, so the takeover id belongs to the credential;
- and, as the standing per-kind mediated writer path of §13.9 rather than anything minted per run,
  the commit path for the `run`, `answer`, `notice` and `migration` keys of its own endpoint.

There is no wildcard form of any of these, on purpose: a space-wide `wfj.>` publish would let one
run's driver append to another run's journal, which is not a read leak but a corruption (the other
run would replay a step it never took), and the barrier's premise is exactly one authoritative
appender per subject. The provisioner holds `STREAM.CREATE`/`STREAM.INFO` on `WFJ_<space>` and
creates it at space setup; agents never hold `STREAM.CREATE` (§13.12).

### 14.7 Conformance (workflow runs)

A conformant driver (v0.5) MUST:

1. Validate a program against `spec/cotal-lang.md` before running it, and run it with the language
   semantics that document defines, under a pin set resolved once and read back on every resume.
2. Mint run ids itself and never reuse one; a fork is a new run under a new id.
3. Append every journal record on the run's own subject under the subject-sequence fence, replay
   before activating, activate under an authorized lease tuple, stop on a refused append after
   activation, and never retry an append at a refreshed head.
4. Write a `pending` entry durably before dispatching its effect, settle from the handler's outcome,
   and treat a refused append as a durability failure that stops the run rather than as the effect's
   outcome.
5. Require the ordinal chain and the run id on replay, refuse a replay below the recorded
   `journalHigh`, and refuse to resume without the recorded pins or under a different language
   version.
6. File answers, notices and migrations under their derived ids, create-only, and render notices
   ahead of the addressee's next turn rather than as channel messages.
7. Hold only the per-run, per-takeover grant family of §14.6.

## Appendix B: Profile ACLs

This appendix is normative for the NATS binding. *(The operator-facing summary of these
grants is [docs/identity-and-auth.md](docs/identity-and-auth.md).)* Names below use these
placeholders:

- `P = cotal.<space>`
- `CHAT = CHAT_<space>`, `DM = DM_<space>`, `TASK = TASK_<space>`
- `DLV = <Plane-3 per-member delivery stream>`; `INBOX = <mixed pre-auth fan-out stream>` (the durable-backstop handoff, §8): fan-out writes `INBOX` (`dinbox.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>`; lifecycle-bound from v0.4, so an inactive-gap or predecessor entry can never migrate to a same-name successor), the trusted reader re-authorizes and transfers to `DLV` (`dlv.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>`, same binding), and the agent binds its own `DLV` DELIVER consumer (filter pinned to its own triple). An agent gets **no** grant on `INBOX` (the mixed pre-auth store).
- `KV = KV_cotal_presence_<space>`
- `CHKV = KV_cotal_channels_<space>`; `DLVKV = <delivery lease/readiness KV>`
- `<owner>.<actor> = the authenticated principal` (§2): `<owner>` and `<actor>` are its two tokens; the dot-form is the wire/KV form, the dash-form `<owner>-<actor>` is the durable-name form
- `connId = the authenticated connection id` (the connection nkey in static mode; the client-chosen nonce in user mode); distinct from the principal, and keys ONLY the reply inbox
- `role = authenticated agent role`
- `chatHistD = chathist_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>`, `dmD = dm_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>`, `dlvD = dlv_<owner>-<actor>-<uid>`, `svcD = svc_<role>` (per-instance durables are lifecycle-scoped from v0.4: keyed on the dash-form + lifecycle UID, §8/§13.1; `svcD` stays role-scoped)
- `inbox = _INBOX_<connId>.>`

Grouped placeholders such as `<CHAT|DM|TASK>` mean one concrete subject per listed token.

### Agent

`sub.allow`:

- `inbox`
- `P.ep.reply.*.*.*.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.*` (exact arity; the agent's own endpoint reply rail: every endpoint's replies to THIS caller triple + nonce, §13.2; replies never ride the per-connection `inbox`)
- `P.epe.…`; the exact fully-qualified event subtrees of every minted read capability
  (§13.9 event-read row), incl. the caller's own per-goal subtree
  `P.epe.*.*.*.goal.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.>`; the live tail of watch, granted per
  capability, none by default
- `P.chat.*.*.<ch>` for every `allowSubscribe` channel, the **live read boundary**: native core-sub join/leave is a `sub.allow`-bounded subscribe to this subject (wildcard sender owner+actor), so an agent whose ACL permits a channel joins it alone with no manager. Wildcards preserved (e.g. `P.chat.*.*.team.>` for `allowSubscribe: team.>`); a `team.>` grant matches strictly deeper channels, not the bare `team`; a `>` grant is read-all chat in the space on credential compromise

`pub.allow`:

- `P.chat.<owner>.<actor>.<ch>` for every `allowPublish` channel (post ACL; none by default)
- `P.inst.*.*.<owner>.<actor>` (DM any recipient, forge-locked to me as sender)
- `P.svc.*.<owner>.<actor>` (anycast any role, as me)
- endpoint request forms per minted capability (§13.9): every agent gets the baseline set
  (`describe` on all endpoints; the delivery endpoint's durable join/leave/list commands;
  self-targeted lifecycle commands with authz-mode `self`); the `spawn` capability adds the
  manager endpoint's lifecycle commands with authz-mode `owner`; `child`/`ledger` forms and
  wider target patterns only per explicitly minted capability. The caller triple
  `<owner>.<actor>.<uid>` is pinned in every granted form
- control-surface durable reads (contract artifacts, decisions, goal results, receipts,
  event catch-up, record reads): **NO raw JetStream read grant of any kind**, no
  `DIRECT.GET`, no consumer `CREATE`, no bind-only `MSG.NEXT`/`ACK`, on `EPC`/`EPF`/`EPE`/the
  records KV. Per §13.9 "Mediated reads", every JetStream read delivers stored bytes to a
  caller-chosen destination the broker does not confine (push `deliver_subject`, pull
  `MSG.NEXT` reply, `DIRECT.GET` reply are the same vector), so an untrusted caller holds none
  of them. The caller reads through the trusted read mediator via a read command (an endpoint
  request form, above) and receives its own caller-scoped facts over its reply rail
  `P.ep.reply.*.*.*.<owner>.<actor>.<uid>.*` (already in `sub.allow`); the mediator owns the
  reader consumers and re-authorizes each read. Live event progress is the caller's own core
  subscription to granted `P.epe.…` subtrees within `allowSubscribe` (bytes land only on its
  own subscription, never a caller-chosen subject)
- `$JS.API.INFO`
- `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.<CHAT|KV|CHKV|DLVKV>`: CHAT plus the world-readable presence/registry/lease KVs only; **not** DM/TASK (agents bind those by name and never inspect them, so INFO there would only leak inbox/task metadata)
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<CHAT>.<chatHistD>.<P.chat.*.*.<ch>>` for every `allowSubscribe` channel (history reads; the single filter the server pins to the body, the agent's only CHAT consumer create. The live tail is the core `sub.allow` subscription above, not a JetStream consumer)
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<CHAT>.<chatHistD>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.<CHAT>.<chatHistD>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.<CHAT>.<chatHistD>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<DM>.<dmD>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.<DM>.<dmD>`
- `$JS.ACK.<DM>.<dmD>.>` (DM inbox: BIND-ONLY its own pre-created `dmD`, never create)
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<DLV>.<dlvD>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.<DLV>.<dlvD>`
- `$JS.ACK.<DLV>.<dlvD>.>`, the **durable backstop**: BIND-ONLY its own pre-created per-member DELIVER consumer `dlvD` (the trusted reader's re-authorized handoff, §8). The agent holds NO grant on the mixed pre-auth `INBOX` fan-out stream.
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<KV>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<KV>.>`
- `$JS.FC.>`
- `$KV.cotal_presence_<space>.<owner>.<actor>`
- `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.<CHKV>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<CHKV>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<CHKV>.>`
- `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.<DLVKV>` (delivery lease/readiness; read-only, non-gating)
- if `role` is set: `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<TASK>.<svcD>`,
  `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.<TASK>.<svcD>`, `$JS.ACK.<TASK>.<svcD>.>`

`pub.deny` (the agent binds these consumers, never creates them; its only consumer-create grant is the pinned per-channel `chatHistD` history create):

- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<DM>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<DM>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DURABLE.CREATE.<DM>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<TASK>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<TASK>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DURABLE.CREATE.<TASK>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<DLV>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<DLV>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DURABLE.CREATE.<DLV>.>`

A bare/multi-filter consumer create on `CHAT` is **not** explicitly denied (that would also deny the
pinned `chatHistD` create the agent needs), so it is default-denied (the agent holds no such allow),
leaving the single-filter history consumer above as the agent's only CHAT consumer.

### Observer

`sub.allow`:

- `P.chat.>`
- `inbox`

Application publish is denied. `pub.allow` contains only read/control verbs needed to read
CHAT history, presence, and channel registry:

- `$JS.API.INFO`
- `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.<CHAT|KV|CHKV>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<CHAT>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<CHAT>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<CHAT>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.<CHAT>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.<CHAT>.>`
- `$JS.ACK.<CHAT>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<KV>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<KV>.>`
- `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.<CHKV>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<CHKV>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<CHKV>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.<CHKV>.>`
- `$JS.FC.>`

### Admin

Admin has observer grants, with `sub.allow = [P.chat.>, P.inst.>, P.svc.>, inbox]`, the
god-view is the **messaging plane only**, enumerated: it deliberately excludes `P.ep.>`,
`P.epe.>`, `P.epf.>`, `P.epj.>`, `P.ept.>`, `P.epr.>`, `P.epw.>`, `P.eps.>`, and `P.epc.>`
(a space-wide `P.>` would plain-subscribe every `ep.one` request rail, collecting reply
nonces the queue-qualified-only rule exists to protect, and every core-only session
frame; §13.2, §13.11). Plus DM history read grants:

- `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.<DM>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<DM>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<DM>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<DM>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.<DM>.>`
- `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.<DM>.>`
- `$JS.ACK.<DM>.>`

Admin still has no application publish grants.

### Scoped host profiles (formerly `manager`)

There is **no allow-all credential**. The privileged host duties are split into scoped,
single-function profiles, each granting only the verbs its function needs and none other:

- `provisioner`: pre-creates the per-instance lifecycle-scoped durables (`dm_…-<uid>`,
  `svc_…`, the per-member `dlv_…-<uid>` handoff) AND the trusted control-surface consumers of
  the §13.9 matrix; `poolD`, `effD`, and the read mediator's reader durables
  (`decD`/`goalD`/`eveD-n`/`recD-n`, owned by the mediator, never by callers, §13.9
  "Mediated reads"), all PULL with exact full-tail filters; and mints scoped credentials;
  ephemeral onboarding authority.
- `deprovisioner`: target-pinned teardown of ONE retired lifecycle's footprint, minted per
  teardown with the target's `(principal, lifecycleUid)` in every exact-name grant; it can
  delete only lifecycle-keyed names, so it structurally cannot reach a same-name successor
  (§13.1).
- `supervisor`: the always-on agent-lifecycle daemon (the manager process's own connection). It
  is the manager endpoint's serve credential (§13.9) and the ONLY holder of the capabilities for
  the delivery endpoint's admin commands (below).
- `delivery`: the server-side Plane-3 infra: fan-out, trusted-reader re-authorization, and the
  membership/ACL records the durable backstop authorizes against (§7), plus the create-only
  channel registrar above. The registrar's runtime path performs only `KV.create` after fresh ACL
  authorization; its scoped host credential necessarily holds value-write authority on the channel
  bucket, while agent credentials retain read-only registry access. It is the `delivery`
  endpoint's serve credential (§13.9); its admin commands, `reloadCreds`, the explicit adoption
  step of standing credential renewal (the daemon re-reads its re-signed creds file, pins the
  identity, swaps its connection, and reconnects the membership feed's rw connection, replying
  with the adopted JWT windows); and `evictPrincipal`, force-drop of a denied principal's live
  connections (system-account CONNZ scan → per-server KICK → re-scan verify, fail-closed on
  partial scans and on owners outside the principal namespace); carry a capability requirement
  minted to the `supervisor` profile **and to the trusted auth path** (§9/§10), which is the
  executor of the §13.1 takeover / terminal-retirement / handle-revocation barriers and calls
  `evictPrincipal` on each revoked credential's `holderPrincipal` (§13.1) as their eviction
  step; agents are broker-denied. `evictPrincipal` is
  wired into those barriers, not
  a standalone admin convenience. Its READ-ONLY twin `principalLiveness` answers whether one
  principal still holds a live connection (the same CONNZ sweep, observer credential only — the
  KICK credential is never opened on that path), reporting `live` / `gone` / `unknown` with scan
  completeness as a separate field and a reply bound to the exact principal queried. It exists
  because eviction cannot serve as its own precondition: a repair that must REFUSE while a holder
  is alive would, using `evictPrincipal` to find out, kill the holder before it could refuse.
  `gone` requires a complete, single-server-proven sweep (§13.13); an under-reporting sweep is
  `unknown`, which never authorizes. The former
  `delivery-admin` control tier is deleted with the v0 rail (§13.11).
- `membership-rw`: the derived channel-membership graph feed reader/writer.
- `operator`, `purger`, `teardown`, `channel-writer`, `control-caller-*`, `deployer`, `probe`: the
  human-CLI and maintenance surfaces, each scoped to its verbs.
- `manager-service` is NOT a generic host profile: on a per-user-auth space only the
  loopback/operator exchange may issue this closed, one-owner/one-fixed-manager-actor/one-instance
  view to a signed-in user with ledger scope `supervise` (§13.1/§13.6). It reaches exactly the
  staged manager registration, contract, status, gate, credential, and same-owner descendant
  provisioning family; public exchange, managed-agent secret exchange, plain user bearers, and all
  other instances are refused.

Standing host credentials are **bounded and renewed**: one-shot profiles carry minutes-scale
expiry; `supervisor`/`delivery`/`membership-rw` carry a 24h expiry with the manager as the named
renewal owner (self-remint for its own credential; same-nkey re-sign + explicit `reloadCreds`
adoption for the seed-less daemons); the two system-account credentials (`membership-observer`,
`connection-evictor`) carry a 30d expiry and are renewable ONLY by a system-account rotation +
broker restart; no persisted system-account minting secret exists, by design. On per-user-auth
spaces, static `agent`/`observer`/`admin` minting is retired entirely (the flip): agent identities
exist only as owner+actor principals under a logged-in user, and the elevated profiles of this
appendix are reached per-connection via the exchange-authored view claim instead (§10). The flip is
deny-new: a static
credential signed before it (or minted out-of-band with the account signing key) remains
broker-valid until signing-key rotation, which is the revocation lever for static material; the
guarantee therefore applies to spaces that never issued static user-facing credentials.

The live channel subscribe depends on none of these; it is broker-enforced via `sub.allow`, so
self-serve live join works with no host present; only the durable backstop and its membership writes
require a privileged host. None of these profiles is ever issued to ordinary agents. On the v0.4
endpoint surface, every host profile's grant rows are **generated from the §13.9 ownership matrix**
(matrix → grants, never the reverse): a profile with no matrix row holds no `ep*`, `$O.`, or
control-surface `$JS.API` authority, and `provision.ts` (`permissionsFor`) is the generated artifact
this appendix summarizes, not an independent authority. This appendix spells out the `agent`,
`observer`, and `admin` profiles that make up the wire-facing security claim.

## Appendix D: Change log

Normative revisions of this document, newest first. Dated snapshots per §11; the wire
`protocolVersion` is the compatibility signal, not these dates.

| Date | Revision |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-08-24 | **Remote user manager authority.** A closed server-authored `manager-service` view permits one registered user-auth participant to operate one opaque manager instance only when their live actor-ledger row carries the dedicated `supervise` scope. `supervise` is distinct from `spawn` and `admin`; public and managed-agent exchanges refuse the view, and plain user bearers remain unprivileged. The host, never the participant, issues public-nkey JWT material through a lifecycle- and instance-bound, typed, replay-safe `prepare → activate → renew` protocol. The family is confined to one derived owner, fixed server-selected manager actor, lifecycle UID, instance registration/contracts/status, gate, and credential rows; descendant provisioning is host-validated for the same owner only. Revocation and renewal deny new material and unsafe restarts fail-closed while retaining live agents only within their independently valid authority. **Breaking pre-1.0 authority change: minor.** |
| 2026-08-19 | **Receiver deduplication MUST NOT use the empty string as a key (§4), and id-less deliveries are individually addressable (§8).** Two distinct received messages MUST NOT be treated as one logical delivery solely because both carry `id: ""`; each remains independently deliverable, and copies that cannot be correlated by wire identity may surface more than once on an at-least-once path. The publisher's §5 obligation to supply a unique string id is unchanged; an absent or non-string id remains a malformed envelope, now enforced at each delivery pump (durable terminate, live drop, history and recall skip). §8 adds that the absence of a usable receiver dedup key does not relax acknowledgement ownership: a JetStream-consumed copy with `id: ""` that is surfaced or handled MUST be acknowledged independently, and the reference implementation realizes that through a per-delivery receive key (never wire identity, never dedup authority) at its drain and in-flight seams. Plane-3 durable fan-out still derives its publish msgID from `CotalMessage.id`, so distinct `id: ""` messages can be collapsed inside the broker's duplicate window on a durable channel before the receiver sees them; that path is its own tracked change and this revision's guarantee is scoped to the receiver. Classification: normative receive-side semantics, no wire-envelope or schema change, `protocolVersion` unchanged. |
| 2026-08-18 | **v0.5 binding revision: workflow runs (§14), additive.** A deployment MAY host durable workflow runs: programs in the Cotal workflow language, defined by the new normative reference [`spec/cotal-lang.md`](spec/cotal-lang.md) (language version `1`: the syntax table, values and the boundary rule, the library, the effect primitives with their hashed projections, the four concurrency scopes and the clock-decided `race`, the step key grammar, journal entry schema, input hash and request id, resume, migrate and fork), whose every effect is recorded in a per-run step journal on the new per-space `WFJ_<space>` stream (one subject per run, no age eviction, no Direct Get, every append fenced by the run subject's own sequence, replay-then-activate takeover with a fencing-token authorization tuple, an ordinal chain and a `journalHigh` anchor). Four core record kinds join §13.7: `run` (split; the resolved pin set on the spec half, holder/lease/`journalHigh` on the status half; driver-minted, never-reused ids), `answer` (atomic, content-derived id, keyed per answer because every presenter is the driver), `notice` (split; addressee keyed by a digest of the name; consumption as status), `migration` (split; content-derived id; application as a create-only status). Driver grants are per run and per takeover, with no wildcard form. `languageVersion` is pinned per run and moves independently of the wire version. No existing kind, subject, grant row or shipped datum changes. |
| 2026-08-16 | **A caller declares the incarnation it resolved against, and a responder that is not it refuses before any effect.** A class-addressed request is delivered to one member of a queue group, and the member that answers need not be the one the caller's `describe` resolved against. The caller could only detect that AFTERWARDS, from the reply subject, by which point the command had run: the split was observable but never preventable, and the reference client's recovery repeated the command. `bind` (§13.3) is the caller's declaration of `{ instanceId, epoch }`, checked by the responder against its own identity at the pre-effect seam, ahead of the governed gate and every handler. A mismatch is `failed-precondition` for a different instance and `expired` for another epoch of the same one, both carrying `details[].kind = ai.cotal.ep.bind-refused` and, per §13.3, `outcome: not-executed`. **ADDITIVE**: `bind` is MAY, a responder that does not implement the fence ignores it under §5 and executes, so the caller-side check remains the only protection in a skewed pair and `protocolVersion` stays 0.4. It confers nothing and narrows only, so it satisfies monotonic attenuation: a request carrying it reaches exactly the instances the subject already routes it to, and can only make one of them refuse. Absent on `describe` (the bootstrap that produces the bind) and on the scatter rail (which addresses every incarnation by construction); on the `inst` rail it MUST name the subject's instance and adds the epoch the subject grammar has no token for. Attribution still comes from the reply subject, never from this block: it is what the caller bound, not a claim about who answered. |
| 2026-08-16 | **A command declares whether repeating it is safe, a responder reports whether a refusal already executed, and the two are separated from idempotency by `id`.** Three gaps that only bite together. **(1) `effect` (§13.7).** Nothing in a resolved command distinguished a read from a mutation — every manager command declares `class: "ephemeral"`, and `traits` carries no repeat-safety — so a client deciding whether to retry had nothing to consult, and the reference client repeats a mutation on a split. Precisely: the automatic repeat belongs to the high-level helper, not to the primitive — `invokeCommand` raises the post-reply currency refusal and stops, and the `invokeService` wrapper around it catches exactly that code, re-resolves, and invokes a second time. Measured on a live broker under a forced instance split, counting at the handler rather than on the wire, the repeated command executes TWICE. `effect` is `read` or `write`, with `read` defined OPERATIONALLY — repeating it changes nothing the command is TRYING to change, and the only excluded difference is the incidental trace of having been called (request ids, spans, logs, metrics, timing) — because the intuitive definition, indistinguishable to every observer, is satisfiable by no real command and would make the field decorative. The state in question is not only the endpoint's own: a command whose intended effect lands elsewhere is still a `write`, and `evictPrincipal` fixes that boundary, since dropping live broker connections while leaving the endpoint's own records untouched is the point of calling it. **(2) `error.outcome` (§13.3).** A refusal code cannot say whether the effect happened: the same code is correct for a request that ran and one that never left. `outcome` is emitted by the RESPONDER, which is the only party that knows — `not-executed` when it refuses before the handler, `executed` when it refuses after, `unknown` when it cannot tell. It describes a reply and only a reply — a caller-side refusal is not an `EndpointReply` and carries no `outcome` field — but it does NOT follow that the caller knows nothing, and the first cut of this amendment wrongly collapsed four distinguishable local cases into `unknown`. A refusal raised BEFORE publication is `not-executed`: the request never left, and calling that `unknown` suppresses a retry that is provably safe even for a `write`. A refusal raised while HOLDING a reply — the §13.2 post-reply currency check is the case in this document — takes what it knows from that reply: `ok:true` means the handler ran, and an `ok:false` reply carries the responder's own `outcome`, which the caller adopts rather than overwrites. A **broker-attested no-responders answer** on the reserved sentinel is also `not-executed`: it is positive evidence that the subject had zero subscribers, trusted only on that sentinel because the same status on an ordinary reply subject is a responder's own claim. Only "no reply observed at all" (deadline, transport failure after publication) is `unknown`. And **a reply proves the request was HANDLED, never that it was EXECUTED** — the version, class, target, sender, authz, contract, and guard checks all publish `ok:false` having executed nothing. It is also not a goal's terminal state (§13.6 owns that) and must not be used as one. **(3) Repeat versus resubmission (§13.8).** `effect` and "idempotent by `id`" are different axes and were unreconciled. They are now separated by CONVERGENCE rather than by token: a **resubmission** is a re-send the responder converges onto the decision it already recorded, a **repeat** is one it accepts as new work, and `effect` governs repeats whatever `id` they carry. Defining the split by the token instead left a hole — a post-horizon re-send under a reused `id` is accepted as new work, so it executes, while formally escaping a prohibition written as "under a fresh `id`". Reusing the token is how a caller ASKS for convergence; it is not the answer. Within the horizon `id` is what convergence is keyed on — and `id` is the whole key on the ephemeral rail but only ONE of the effect-defining dimensions the journal fingerprint binds — endpoint, command, `id`, `goalId`, `class`, args, both contract digests, the authorization mode, the target, `auth`, and the caller — where same id + different args is neither dedup nor a fresh call but a loud `conflict`. **Both rails are bounded by a horizon**, realized by decision-fact and result retention rather than by a clock, and outside it neither rule applies: the `id` carries no history, a re-send under it is a fresh call that WILL execute, and the same `id` with different args is no longer a `conflict`. A finite horizon is what keeps the decision store finite, so this is a fact callers must hold rather than a hole to close — and because a repeat is defined by acceptance rather than by token, a post-horizon same-`id` re-send of a `write` is exactly what §13.7 forbids a client to make automatically. A command idempotent by `id` is therefore NOT thereby `read`: safe to resubmit is not safe to repeat — and the dangerous reading is a reasonable one, since an operator who retries after a timeout mints a fresh `id` because the old request is gone. **NON-ADDITIVE, and versioned as such:** a client that ignored `effect` would keep performing exactly the retry the field exists to stop, so it rides `protocol.v` — the marker that ALREADY EXISTS on the service record spec and the describe descriptor, never a new field on the cluster document, which has no `protocol` and where §7 would drop it unread by exactly the clients this must stop. An instance whose clusters declare `effect` registers and describes at `v:2`; `v:1` descriptors stay valid, carry no `effect`, and every command served under one reads as `write`. The caller-side refusal of a `protocol.v` it does not implement is a requirement this cut CREATES, not one already met: today `describe`'s pinned output schema fixes `descriptor.protocol.v` to the constant `1`, so an unamended responder cannot publish a `v:2` descriptor at all, and the registry reader refuses a service record that is not `v:1` — but the resolving caller validates neither, and the shape it reads does not carry `protocol`. The responder-side fence is what protects old clients today, and only until this cut widens that constant. **Release order was the wrong instrument and is withdrawn**: a same-release ordering rule has no observable runtime meaning, since a release is not a deployment and an already-running v1 caller is unchanged by whatever a new artifact contains. **The cutover rule is §11's, and §13.7 does not state one.** Moving to `protocol.v: 2` IS a non-additive discovery change, so the §11 rule for one (previous row, landed first) is the sole authority on how it rolls out. §13.7 carries only what is specific to `2`: a caller that resolves a descriptor whose `protocol.v` it does not implement MUST fail the resolve (`unsupported-version`) and MUST NOT invoke against it — a descriptor it cannot read is no descriptor, and reading it as `v:1` reinstates the repeat — and implementing that refusal is what makes a caller count as having ADOPTED the section for §11's condition. Two intermediate drafts had to be withdrawn to reach that: one sited the cutover in §13.7 as a same-release ordering clause, which has no observable runtime meaning because a release is not a deployment; the next stated the cutover in BOTH sections, which is a single-source-of-truth defect, since two normative statements of one rule agree until either is edited and then silently become two conformance rules. The reason it cannot be sited here is the durable part: the condition is a property of the whole deployment, and a responder cannot evaluate it — no in-band negotiation, no caller version on the wire — so a rule stated here would bind the one party unable to check it. |
| 2026-08-16 | **A non-additive discovery change is an out-of-band deployment cutover and rolls out CALLER-FIRST (§11).** The preceding §11 rule says v0 has no in-band capability negotiation and that deployments agree out of band; this says what that obliges when a discovery change CANNOT be ignored safely — where an unamended client that drops the new field per §7 would then behave in the very way the change exists to prevent, so no default value repairs the direction that matters. The obligation rests on the DEPLOYMENT, because neither participant can discharge it: a responder cannot tell an amended caller from an unamended one, since no request carries a caller version and `describe`'s answer is read by the caller without a version check. So every caller adopts the new rules BEFORE any responder registers or describes at the new version, and the two halves SHOULD ship in SEPARATE releases — **a release is not a deployment**, and an already-running caller is unchanged by whatever a new artifact contains, so the order of two source edits proves nothing about the processes on the wire. `protocol.v` on the registered service record is the observable marker: "has any responder cut over" is a checkable registry property, while "has every caller adopted" is the out-of-band agreement §11 already requires. **The residual is stated rather than engineered around**: an early cutover exposes unamended callers to exactly what the new version prevents, and within v0 nothing in band detects it — closing that needs negotiation v0 does not have, and the v1 marker owns it. Prose only: no schema, no wire field, no code. |
| 2026-08-14 | **The auth-admin rail moves off the retired `ctl` surface onto the endpoint SUBJECTS (a subject-plane migration, NOT yet a conforming endpoint - see the residual below), and its authz description is corrected to what ships.** TWO defects on the same §13.9 rows, fixed together. **(1) The rail.** The rows served the auth plane's generic "retire a lifecycle" operation on `ctl.auth-admin.<owner>.<actor>` — a rail §13.11 retires in full and states MUST NOT be handled. New normative rows written onto a deleted rail are defects, not exceptions to it, so they are rewritten onto the v0.4 endpoint surface rather than given scoping language: `ep.one.auth.retire-lifecycle.handle.<tO>.<tA>.<tUid>.<cO>.<cA>.<cUid>.<nonce>`, served queue-qualified on the class rail, with the reply DERIVED from the parsed request (the bound-reply rule becomes structural — no caller- or payload-supplied reply target can arrive) and the request/reply planes disjoint, so the listener credential cannot express a request subject and the self-forge closes by grammar. The requester credential now pins its caller TRIPLE and exactly ONE target incarnation, so a leaked requester cannot be re-aimed. §13.11 is unchanged and gains no carve-out. **(2) The authz sentence.** These rows described serve-time authz as a space-manager-LEASE holder check; the implementation replaced that with the serve-issuance-gate check on 2026-07-22 without a spec change, so the normative text had been false since. It now describes what ships — a fresh leader-served read of `epgate.<serveEndpoint>.<serveInstanceId>` requiring presence, the declared epoch, and THE PRINCIPAL CROSS-CHECK (`row.principal` must equal the subject-derived caller principal), the last being new here: the two-token `ctl` subject could not express the caller beyond an alias, so the rail had accepted ANY registered instance's gate. The binding is stated as ALIAS-LEVEL, not incarnation-level: the gate is keyed by the persisted `instanceId` and its row carries no lifecycle uid, so a same-principal predecessor presenting the current epoch still passes; binding the publishing incarnation needs a gate-row schema change and is not attempted here. **NAMED RESIDUAL (Cotal #399) - THE RAIL IS NOT A CONFORMING ENDPOINT: it carries the endpoint SUBJECTS only. It still exchanges the pre-v0.4 `{op,args}` / `{ok,data,error}` bodies this document states are DELETED, registers no `svc.<endpoint>.<instanceId>` service record, does not serve the reserved `describe`, and has no contract/cluster artifact - so a GENERIC endpoint client can neither discover nor invoke this command. The exploitable half is closed in this change - the request carries a caller-chosen `id`, the responder echoes it on every reply, and the caller refuses any reply that does not echo, so a wrong-id `ok:true` cannot clear a retirement hold - but the versioned typed envelope, contract digests, `class`, deadline/`replyExpected` semantics, structured errors, service registration and `describe` are a separate cut tracked at #399, whose acceptance test is that a GENERIC client can discover and invoke the command. Recorded here rather than left implicit: serving a deleted envelope on the new rail is the same class of defect as serving on a deleted subject.** |
| 2026-07-19 | **v0.4 amendment continuation: retirement cleaner inventory is discovery-only.** The terminal retirement barrier no longer accepts a caller-supplied `(endpoint, pools)` hint: the per-op cleaner and settlement-executor pool set is now DISCOVERY-ONLY, exactly the retiring lifecycle's accepted `oblig.<uid>.>` pool routes discovered from the just-drained obligation set. This SUPERSEDES the round-11 optional-hint clause (the 2026-07-15 row): the hint was a TRUSTED ADDITIVE AUTHORITY input that would mint a bounded per-op credential for a pool with no backing obligation, and the despawn rail never exercised it (always an empty hint), so it was grant-widening surface with no production caller. Every grant now scopes to exactly the pools the target holds accepted work on, and the §13.9 residuals cover only those discovered pools. The intent's `endpoints` field is removed from the closed operation-intent schema; a pre-change durable intent that still carries it fails the closed-schema check on resume (the v0.4 hard-cut window, where a clean broker holds none). |
| 2026-07-16 | **v0.4 amendment continuation: connect-arm deny-new (production activation R1).** Every bearer carries its incarnation's root credential id (`act.credentialId`); the exchange mints the root credential RELEASE-LAST (active `cred.` row durable, gate finalize, lifecycle-head current-root CAS, bearer bytes last) and the connect authority requires the LIVE row (leader-served from the shape-proved primary auth store, re-proved on every rebind) plus root head equality, so revoking the row denies the next connect and a superseded or crash-orphaned root issuance never authenticates. The root credential is **incarnation-wide** (ratified): one row per incarnation, re-stamped (the same id) every exchange for its 90d life, never a fresh id per exchange, so one revoke denies every bearer of the incarnation, and a crash after the head CAS re-exports the same id by design (nothing unobserved to revoke; the only pre-release crash window is a durable unstamped row, denied by head equality). The authority store shape proof binds the stream to the actual KV bucket (exactly the one `$KV.<bucket>.>` subject + durable file storage, in addition to the primary/un-mirrored/non-evicting/`allow_direct` flags) at every bind and at boot ensure. Claimless bearers, revoked/expired/absent rows, and an unreadable authority store deny outright (no file-only fallback; a failed reader-credential renewal downs the reader immediately and denies). The head's current-root stamp moves only ABSENT to value: root rotation without the full family-revoke barrier is refused structurally. Named R1 residuals: a same-alias re-grant while the predecessor incarnation is live refuses the exchange (production issuance runs no takeover barrier yet), and the auth service's reader/mint-writer are seed-signed infra credentials (revoked by service stop or signing-seed rotation) pending the ledgered infra-mint family. |
| 2026-07-16 | **v0.4 amendment continuation: retirement settlement authority split.** A seventh round (an independent cold read on the landed barrier plus the panel's authority ruling) split terminal pool cleanup across two profiles: the bounded cleaner keeps ONLY bind-scoped fetch, leader-served EPF terminal-observe reads, and ACK (its former own-pool `wrk` terminal-forge residual is REMOVED with the grant; its remaining residuals are terminal-free ACK suppression and the space-wide read exposure), while the op-bounded retirement settlement executor (a new §13.9 row) owns the intent-closed lease-record CAS and the lease-derived `wrk` terminal publish, carrying the relocated, intent-confined forge residual. Settlement is lease-fenced: an already-settled lease (a crashed owner's `committed`) dominates and is never overwritten. Effects-route completion is a new CLOSED `eff` fact (subject-bound caller and id; `fingerprint` and `sourceSeq` bound to the accepted decision), an action's completion requires the parsed `goal….result` fingerprint match, and subject presence never proves quiescence. The mediator's obligation-row residual is stated honestly (an operation/header-blind KV publish: valid-terminal overwrite or DEL/PURGE markers, refused loud by readers; the records stream denies stream-API message-delete/purge), and the caller-selected-reply confused-deputy injection residual is named for every raw `MSG.GET`/`MSG.NEXT` profile. |
| 2026-07-15 | **v0.4 amendment (folds into the in-flight §13 revision below): lifecycle and admission fences.** Three-state lifecycle head (`active | retiring | retired`; currency only at `active`; `mappingRevision` = the head key's store revision), space-global never-deleted UID reservation (`uid.<lifecycleUid>`), per-kind issuance-gate operation intents and their allowed-transition sets, the locked terminal barrier order (obligation drain to quiescence before the exact-pool cleaner, both before frontiers), the §13.8 authority-head reservation/drain protocol (create-fence + proof-gated admission + per-class decision coordinates + writer≠target reclamation), the endpoint-wide admission-policy coordinate (the governance head + `policyRevision`) with drain-gated policy enforcement, the `ep` sentinel for untargeted admissions, and bind-time store shape proofs (§13.12). Refined per the re-verify round: the govern head's NORMATIVE policy selector `{ enforcedPolicyKey, enforcedPolicyRevision, pendingPolicy… }` with a stage/drain/promote mutation order (so the enforced policy is machine-selectable during the drain window), the `self`-class obligation's complete commit intent `{ commitKey, commitBaseRevision, commitValue, commitDigest }` (the pinned BYTES, not just a digest) with deterministic `accepted → terminal` recovery and full-intent create-join (an accepted-but-uncommitted row never blocks quiescence), the retirement barrier's cleaner-credential revoke + verified-eviction BEFORE any frontier records, the LIMITS-retention bind-time proof (a non-Limits authority store deletes rows on consumer ack), and the runtime gate parse rejecting impossible `retired`-under-takeover/registration state. A second re-verify round added: the head's `lastTakeoverOpId` (the epoch advance stamps the completing op, so a losing concurrent takeover never claims the winner's completion), the immutable revision-addressed admission-policy key (a mutable per-instance slot loses the old revision under history 1 during the drain), the `epgate.principal` and the rule that a ledger row's `holderPrincipal` is ALWAYS a CONNZ-attributable principal (the endpoint NAME forms the `epcred.` key in a separate field, never the eviction target), and the lifecycle barrier's session-pair teardown (a takeover revoking a `session.`-derived credential terminalizes the session and revokes the paired serving row). A third round (a convergent panel + independent cold read) added: the normative immutable `policy` record kind `policy.<endpoint>.<digest-hex>` (self-certifying content-addressed key; the govern selector names exactly this kind, replacing the per-deployment "versioned key" allowance), the CLOSED `commitValue` union (`{ enc: "b64u", bytes }` exact base64url value bytes, or `{ enc: "ref", key }` naming an immutable records key; `commitDigest` = `sha256:<hex>` over the raw value bytes), proof-issuance PAUSE for policy-admitted decisions while a `pendingPolicy…` is staged (which makes the policy drain converge and the after-final-enumeration no-admit rule hold for policy movement), the serving-principal JOIN into the lifecycle barrier's verified-eviction set (a session-pair teardown returns the paired serving row's holder principal and the barrier evicts it before the epoch CAS), and the torn-coordinate takeover guard (the intent capture re-proves head coherence, and the freeze CAS is preceded by a head-currency read, so a stale intent never freezes the winner's reopened gate). A fourth round (a convergent re-verify + independent cold read) added: the drain-window admission pause is now a NORMATIVE step of the §13.8 admission algorithm (the mediator's create-fence AND post-create recheck leader-read the govern head and refuse a policy-admitted decision while a `pendingPolicyKey` is staged, which also bounds the never-deleted `oblig` set during a long drain), the §13.9 matrix records the mediator's govern-head and policy-version read authority, the `policy` kind's immutability is stated honestly as a trusted-writer create-only-CAS invariant backed by read-time self-certification rather than a broker-level update/delete subtraction (KV operations share one subject), and the takeover barrier's crash-boundary recovery COMPLETES containment (revoke + reconcile + verified-evict every family holder) BEFORE it aborts a stale/torn freeze, so a crash after a partial revoke never leaves a revoked credential's connection live. A fifth round (panel + independent cold read on the B2 mediator) refined: `commitDigest` is the RFC-8785 canonical content digest of the committed value, `sha256:<hex>` (not a raw-bytes digest, so it is insensitive to a non-canonical storage stringify), and `commitValue`'s `b64u`/`ref` forms both resolve that same value; the policy publication is content-addressed by the same canonical digest (property-order-insensitive). The session expiry sweep now enumerates a marker-preserving stream read rather than the bucket's `keys()` (which filters DEL/PURGE), so a tombstoned session key is reported as corruption, not silently skipped. The terminal barrier's frontier record is pinned as the `frontier.<lifecycleUid>` kind (§13.7: create-only, never deleted, one key per retired lifecycle, recorded once under its own operation's `opId` before the gate/head terminals), and the exact-pool cleaner's `retired` disposition is a first-class `wrk` terminal fact carrying its operation and retiring-target binding. A sixth round (the D14 confinement review) pinned the two mediated-profile grant shapes: the admission mediator's enumeration consumer carries a deterministic (endpoint, connection)-bound name with name-literal CREATE/INFO/MSG.NEXT/DELETE rows (closing the name-wildcard cross-consumer reach; the own-name delete is what keeps the fixed name reusable across filters), both profiles' reply inboxes are connection-scoped (`_INBOX_<connId>.>`, never the account-wide default), and both payload-blind write residuals are named with equal explicitness: the mediator's own-endpoint acceptance-forge and the cleaner's own-pool `wrk` terminal-forge (work suppression or mis-settlement), each confined to its subject-expressible scope. A seventh round (the control-surface sealed-scanner seal) moved the dynamic-enumeration `CONSUMER.CREATE` off every standing/runtime credential (the takeover/retirement/handle-revocation barrier and the session sweep on `cotal_auth_<space>`, and the admission mediator plus the retirement obligation-drain on `cotal_records_<space>`) into dedicated SEALED scanners the trusted process opens for itself and NEVER hands out, because a consumer-create request BODY is not subject-ACL confinable (an extended name+filter grant still admits a `durable_name` + push `deliver_subject` exporter of every current/future row that survives connection close and revocation, nats-server#8274, reproduced live); each scanner is pinned to one literal consumer name under a forced pull/`LastPerSubject`/ephemeral/memory config, bind-verified before use and unconditionally deleted after, its CREATE filter confined to its subtree, space-bonded so a hand-assembled or foreign-space scanner never enumerates, and fence-free by construction (a `LastPerSubject` read carries no upper cutoff, so a same-subject overwrite during the scan is SEEN, not dropped). Its re-verify round hardened the seal from asserted to enforced: the scanner capability handle is immutable once branded (a swapped scan op throws rather than surviving the injection assert; that mutation vector was reachable only from inside the trusted process, the signing-seed residual class, never externally), every scan over a space's literal consumer name serializes process-wide (a second scanner instance can never interleave with a live scan and return a partial enumeration; cross-process duplication remains excluded by the one-authority-plane-per-space composition), every delivered subject is revalidated against the exact requested filter (an out-of-filter delivery from a foreign re-resolution of the literal name is refused loud; a foreign SAME-OR-NARROWER filter remains covered by the one-plane composition, not by this check), the two scanner profiles are explicit §13.9 matrix rows whose grant builders the mechanical matrix audit pins as the SOLE dynamic-enumeration `CONSUMER.CREATE` holders on the two authority streams (the provisioner's pre-created full-tail reader durables remain the one other records-stream consumer authority, and the audit pins that complete surface too), and the admission-mediator coordinate stays package-internal until a composition owns the one-records-scanner-per-space injection. An eighth round (the control-surface piece-2/4 wiring) landed: the record-reader provisioning seam is an ALLOWLIST over one canonical authority-def collection (a reader durable's kind must be a registered caller-readable record kind, so every authority-control kind and every unregistered kind refuse, and a dual-token kind whose atomic head is authority admits only a filter strictly deeper than the head, never one that can match or is shallower than the head key); that classification is runtime-frozen and the seam consults a private module-load snapshot, so a post-import mutation cannot remove the guard (the same integrity discipline is applied to every exported security-relevant collection: the baseline grant vocabularies, the credential-lifetime matrix, the session terminal states, the schema profile, and the broker floor are all frozen, and the minting-path consumers read private snapshots). The retirement barrier's cleaner authority is SPLIT into two per-operation credentials: a zero-write cleaner (its residual is terminal-free ACK suppression) and a settlement executor that alone holds the lease-record CAS and the lease-derived `wrk` terminal publish on the intent's exact pools plus the leader-served EPF and records fencing reads its own code path performs (NO EPW read: the settlement path settles or expires through the lease key before any EPW live-entry probe, so that read is unreachable and ungranted); the two are distinct CONNZ principals fenced independently before any frontier records, and the barrier runs settlement on the executor's own connection rather than its standing one. The retirement barrier is the `frontier.<lifecycleUid>` writer (the exact-arity `frontier.*` grant row), and the auth service's boot crash-resume finishes an owed retirement through the assembled deps (a per-endpoint short-lived drain client over the reviewed admission-mediator profile sharing the plane's sealed records scanner, and the per-op cleaner/executor split), fail-closed and loud like the takeover resume. Its re-verify round closed three composition gaps: the barrier now grants `STREAM.INFO` for exactly the CLOSED retirement-frontier stream set (the per-space lifecycle-data streams EPF/EPW/EPE/records, one source feeding both the intent validation and the grant, so a frontier read is never denied on a real broker nor a caller-selected arbitrary stream), the settlement executor drops the unreachable EPW live-entry read (the settlement path settles or expires through the lease key before any EPW probe, so that grant was dead), and the assembled drain completes every settleable obligation but fails CLOSED with an operator-legible frozen-not-lost message on accepted work that needs a confined commit-applier/route-reconciler authority (a scoped boundary whose full mechanics are a separate reviewed slice, never a broad records-write grant bolted onto the drain). A ninth round (the cross-process plane-ownership seal, §13.13) closed the last composition assumption the sealed scanners leaned on: at most one authority plane per space now holds them by a broker-visible claim, one exact never-deleted auth-KV `plane` row binding the two non-reconnecting scanner connections' broker identities, taken by create/revision-CAS with the candidates INERT until the win (no scan capability exists before it); a stale `held` row is reclaimed on LIVENESS ALONE (both claimed tuples conclusively absent under a COMPLETE connection sweep, adjudicated by the delivery daemon's closed read-only oracle over the delivery-admin rail; the auth process holds no `$SYS`), with no TTL, no heartbeat, and no sealed-scan-progress bit (a mid-scan crash reclaims; a paused-but-live plane keeps its connections and its ownership); the winner re-validates the claim before AND after every sealed scan (refuse or discard), an owned scanner disconnect fences the plane (invalidate exposure, close the sibling, never a transparent reconnect into a successor's consumer), clean close releases only after the scan clients are down, the three operator refusal faces carry distinct copy (live peer / inconclusive-fail-safe / mid-life fenced stop), and the launcher adds an exclusive-create pidfile belt. Its re-verify round hardened the reclaim and the fence: a `gone` verdict is valid only under the single-nats-server-process boundary, proven per observation from the responding server's own topology declaration in the `$SYS` reply envelope (any cluster self-report, multi-server observation, or missing declaration reads `unknown`; leafnode/gateway-extended accounts and backup-restore-onto-a-fresh-broker are named residuals; multi-server needs an incarnation/roster authority) — never inferred from which servers replied, which could neither be enforced by reply-counting (a partition shows one responder) nor flipped to require-the-claimed-server's-reply (a restarted server can never reply, the permanent-wedge horn); claim re-validation covers the two pinned scanner tuples (a tuple-only row rewrite is a lost claim); a scanner-death fence is FATAL to the whole authority plane (every authority operation refuses and the service exits loud, never a healthy-looking half-dead plane); the plane credentials' non-expiring boundary is normative (exactly the two non-reconnecting plane connections; every other authority credential keeps short-expiry + renewal); the claim row, connection tuple, oracle-query, and oracle-result schemas are closed exactly (unknown fields refuse, at every level); only successful well-formed CONNZ pages count toward a reclaim sweep (an API error, malformed envelope, non-string cluster declaration, id mismatch, or incomplete page poisons the observation); every sweep's reply inbox carries a per-call nonce (concurrent sweeps cannot cross-complete); the fenced plane's refusals are audience-split (a retryable unavailability to connecting agents, the state-3 restart copy to the operator's log and exit line); and the pidfile belt publishes atomically pre-populated (temp inode + no-overwrite `link(2)`; an empty slot is unpublishable and a pre-protocol one reclaims exactly once). A tenth round (the confined drain repairers) closed the retirement drain's accepted-work boundary functionally: the fail-closed applyCommit/reconcile interim is replaced by two per-op, per-repair principals — the COMMIT APPLIER (`local.epapl_<opId-hash>`, one exact records-KV publish row, minted only for a key inside the CLOSED self-commit class derived from the canonical frozen kind registry + the commit-path writer metadata, so a forged accepted-self row can never name an authority coordinate into a grant) and the POOL-ROUTE RECONCILER (`local.eprec_<opId-hash>`, one exact EPW item create-publish row, executing only a MEDIATOR-DERIVED closed repair command: the mediator reads and row-binds the durable acceptance decision itself and derives the exact subject + the §13.6 canonical acceptance item bytes, now a normative derivation so first enqueues and crash repairs are byte-identical) — each minted per repair, executed, closed, with the CAS-header and payload-blind residuals named per profile; an accepted self-commit now re-applies (or classifies landed/superseded) and an accepted pool route re-materializes, so a retirement with covered accepted work COMPLETES on resume, and an accepted EFFECTS route with no completion marker terminalizes through the RETIREMENT-CANCEL terminal (§13.8 option (i)): the effects completion fact becomes a closed two-member union (ran, or `cancelled: { opId, target }` — the same identity spine, never a forged success, written only for the retiring target's own acceptances), an action's goal union already carries the first-class `cancelled` state (the retirement attribution rides its digest-bound payload), the cancel publishes CREATE-ONLY on the SAME completion subject so first-terminal-wins is structural in both directions, and a third per-op principal (`local.epcan_<opId-hash>`, one exact completion-subject create row) executes the mediator-derived repair — so a retirement with in-flight accepted effects work now COMPLETES on resume with a reader-legible cancelled terminal instead of freezing. An eleventh round (the despawn→retirement trigger, the P1 closure) reserved the `auth-admin` control service (SPEC 13.2): the AUTH plane serves the GENERIC "retire a lifecycle" operation on the `ctl` grammar's subject-attributed rail (the delivery-admin discipline: broker-ACL caller attribution, bound replies, an unbound reply target dropped before processing), authorized at SERVE TIME by the fresh space-manager-lease holder check (one leader-served read of the manager bucket's single lease key; holder == the subject-attributed requester principal; DEL/PURGE markers and TTL-expunged rows read absent and refuse fail-closed — never mint-time trust, closing the post-lease-loss window), answering the four-outcome idempotence table in operator vocabulary with every refusal a stated COMPLETE no-op; the space manager triggers it per despawn through an ephemeral request-and-reply-only `retirement-requester` credential with a STABLE per-lifecycle opId (retries, same-name-spawn nudges, and boot resumes converge on one operation), holds the despawned name RESERVED-pending-retirement until the terminal (a same-name spawn refuses legibly and re-drives the request; the in-memory reservation's restart residual is named — the durable truth is the lifecycle head itself), and the retirement executes through the plane's own reviewed deps over its ONE sealed records scanner. The barrier's terminal cleaner/executor pool set is the operation's EFFECTIVE INVENTORY: the target's accepted `oblig.<uid>.>` pool routes discovered from the just-drained obligation set UNIONED with the intent's OPTIONAL trusted hint (the despawn rail passes none), superseding the round-8 "intent's exact pools" enumeration so an empty-hint despawn still settles every accepted pool item before the frontier; the durable-intent hint is a TRUSTED ADDITIVE AUTHORITY input (a hinted pool with no accepted obligation still receives a bounded per-op credential), and the compromised cleaner/executor residuals scope to that whole effective inventory, including any hint-only pool. |
| 2026-07-10 | **v0.4 binding revision: endpoint control surface (§13).** One standardized typed surface for every endpoint (manager, delivery, wrapped third-party servers): class/instance/scatter rails with per-command broker enforcement and an authorization-mode gradient, lifecycle identity (recyclable alias + never-reused lifecycle UID + fenced process epoch, §13.1, §2/§6/§8 extensions), versioned envelope with structured errors and signed slots, three delivery contracts (ephemeral, split-key records, untrusted submissions → mediated canonical facts), verbs call/cast/watch/claim/scatter (claim owner-mediated: workers hold no pool grant), composites (action, checkpoint, guard, capability handle with redemption-pinned `handle`-mode targets, session, virtual endpoints), content-addressed cluster contracts + governed traits + describe, the ownership matrix (incl. exact reader/consumer/ack rows and pinned consumer-name grammars), takeover/retirement revoke-and-evict barriers over the full ledgered credential family (credential ledger, §13.1), mediated timer arming (request/armed/fire split with a scheduler-origin fire check), poison quarantine facts, an epoch-pinned record-write ingress plane (`epr`), a single-message digest-subject contract store (`epc`), pre-created pull-only reader consumers (no dynamic reader creates: a create's delivery target is body-set and unconfined), an alias CAS head for lifecycle activation, and receipts and trust anchors. **Hard cut:** deletes the v0 `ctl` rail, `ControlRequest`/`ControlReply`, the `self`/`manager`/`admin`/`delivery-admin` tiers, and the reserved `control.<instance>` subject. `protocolVersion` targets `0.4` at migration completion; `1.0` stays reserved as a later stability declaration. |
| 2026-07-07 | Documentation revision, no wire change: layered authority statement (schema authoritative for shapes, prose for semantics), document-snapshot policy and this change log (§11), reciprocal links to the informative docs. |
| 2026-07-03 | **v0.3 binding revision: owner+actor identity.** The wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`: subjects carry the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id` re-key onto the pair (§2, §3, §6, §8, §9). The connection nkey remains only the transport credential (the per-connection reply inbox). Adds the per-user-auth authorization grammar and the owner-token format (§2, §9). Supersedes the single-id grammar. |
| 2026-06-21 | **v0.3 binding revision: channel live delivery.** Channel live delivery moves from the mediated per-instance live-tail durable to native `sub.allow`-bounded core subscriptions, with an explicit per-channel `live`/`durable` delivery class and the per-member durable backstop (§4, §7, §8); membership moves to a privileged-written registry (§7). Supersedes the v0.2 single-durable live-tail. |
| earlier | v0.2 and before predate change control: the v0.2 contract (single mediated live-tail durable binding) is superseded by v0.3 and kept only in history. |
