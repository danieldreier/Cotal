/**
 * Shared smoke helper: own a spawned `nats-server` so it dies when this process is SIGNALLED, not
 * only when the suite returns and its `finally` runs.
 *
 * SCOPE, AND A CORRECTION TO THE FIRST VERSION OF IT. This helper covers ONE of two defects, and an
 * earlier draft of this paragraph claimed it covered the only one. It said `finally` teardown is
 * already correct on the normal path, which was measured — ten `bind-fence` runs on a long-lived box
 * left zero brokers and zero store dirs — but measured on ONE suite and then stated about all of
 * them. It does not hold generally. `channels-auth.smoke.ts` has no teardown at all: it passes,
 * reports `AUTH GRANT CHECKS PASSED`, and leaks its store dir on every green run. Sixty-two of them
 * had accumulated over four days when that was finally counted.
 *
 * So there are two defects, and this helper is only the answer to the second:
 *
 *   1. NO NORMAL-PATH TEARDOWN. Nothing to unwind, so the suite leaks whether or not it is killed.
 *      Six suites are in this state. Ownership does NOT fix them, and worse, it makes them read as
 *      handled while they keep manufacturing directories on every pass.
 *   2. TEARDOWN THAT NEVER UNWINDS. The `finally` is correct and the process is SIGNALLED, so it
 *      never runs. That is what this file exists for, and it changes nothing else.
 *
 * Adopting this helper in a suite with defect 1 is a rename, not a fix. Check the normal path first.
 *
 * The two registrations below are INDEPENDENTLY SUFFICIENT under `tsx`, which is worth stating
 * because it is not obvious and it was only established by trying to disable each one: removing
 * either alone still tears the broker down, and only removing OWNERSHIP reinstates the leak. That is
 * why the suite's mutation targets `owned.add` rather than a hook.
 *
 * PARENTAGE IS THE DISCRIMINATOR, NOT ARGV. The helper holds the child handle it spawned and never
 * has to recognize the process later. That matters because argv fails in BOTH directions on a real
 * box: it under-matches (of 151 `spawn("nats-server"` sites, 38 pass a store dir and no config at
 * all, and one passes a prebuilt args variable), and it over-matches (a `server-open.conf` rule
 * covers 8 processes, only some of which are ever a real mesh). Worse, an argv marker can outlive the
 * file it names: across a fuller census of 15 live orphans, 4 named a config path that no longer
 * exists, deleted by the very cleanup that failed to kill the process. Anything that validates a
 * candidate by stat-ing its config would refuse to reap exactly those four.
 *
 * Two numbers above were revised once the census went from 4 orphans to 15: the `server-open.conf`
 * count was 7, and "every one of the 4 observed orphans" was true of the 4 then visible but is 4 of
 * 15 now. The conclusion is unchanged and so is the reason for it; only the ratio was overstated,
 * and an overstated ratio in a paragraph arguing against a matching strategy is worth correcting.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, and it must be read as a limit rather than a solved problem: SIGKILL is
 * uncatchable. `kill -9` on a suite kills the handle along with the process, and the broker is
 * orphaned with nothing holding it. The minted store-dir token below is the only surviving evidence
 * in that case, and it is what a separate reaper matches. Parentage covers the case this helper
 * fixes; the token covers the case it cannot. Neither covers both.

 * The minted token: the prefix plus THIS PROCESS'S PID, so the dir records not just "a smoke broker"
 * but "whose". A broker started through this helper is recognizable after its owner is SIGKILLed; a
 * broker started around it is not, so a reaper is only ever as complete as migration.
 *
 * THE PID IS HERE BECAUSE MARKING THE BROKER WAS NOT ENOUGH, and the gap was live rather than
 * theoretical. A reaper matching the prefix alone claims every migrated suite's broker, not every
 * LEAKED one, and two suites run concurrently on a shared box constantly. Reproduced: a second lane
 * minting through this token and holding its broker with the owner still alive was listed for the
 * kill by a prefix-only reaper. It would have SIGKILLed a live broker mid-run and reddened that lane
 * with a diagnosis pointing at its own code, which is the "worse than no reaper" case exactly.
 *
 * Every call site keeps working unchanged, because this is still just a `mkdtemp` prefix. Sites that
 * append their own tag after it still match, since the owner is parsed from the pid segment rather
 * than from the whole name.

/**
 * Kill a broker and DO NOT RETURN until it is actually gone, so the caller's `rmSync` cannot race a
 * process still writing into the tree it is walking.
 *
 * This exists because that race is not theoretical. `bind-fence` sent SIGTERM and removed its tree on
 * the next line; in CI the recursive walk hit a directory nats-server had just written back into and
 * the suite died on `ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty, rmdir
 * '/tmp/cotal-smoke-broker-LilWsp/jetstream/$G/streams/KV_cotal_records_bindfence/msgs'` after every
 * one of its cells had passed.
 *
 * SIGTERM is the reason the window is wide: it asks nats-server to shut down GRACEFULLY, and a
 * graceful shutdown FLUSHES JetStream state to disk. So the signal that is polite to the broker is
 * precisely the one that keeps it writing while the removal walks. Modelled on a fixture that flushes
 * for 250ms after SIGTERM, removing straight away failed 4 times out of 4; waiting for the exit first
 * succeeded 4 out of 4.
 *
 * A NOTE ON WHAT DOES NOT WORK, so nobody re-derives it from the docs. Node's own retry options on
 * `rmSync` (`maxRetries`/`retryDelay`) name ENOTEMPTY explicitly and look like the native answer. They
 * are not: measured on the same fixture they failed 4 out of 4 while burning 5.7 seconds, because the
 * retry re-attempts the failed `rmdir` and never re-walks the directory, so files created during the
 * first walk are never removed and the `rmdir` can never succeed. Waiting is the fix; retrying is not.
 *
 * Never throws — it runs on the teardown path, where a throw would replace the real cause of death.
 * If the broker ignores the first signal it is escalated to SIGKILL rather than waited on forever.
