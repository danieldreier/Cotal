/**
 * NO IMPLICIT #general.
 *
 * An agent reads exactly the channels it lists. Omitting the read set means NO channels, not
 * `general`. Before this, four separate places defaulted an absent read set to `["general"]` — the
 * agent-file loader, the provisioner, the mint, and the endpoint — so a persona that simply did not
 * mention channels (every DM-only reviewer, every probe seat) was subscribed to `general` by code
 * and had the matching channel read row baked into its credential. Nobody chose that channel; the
 * absence of a field did.
 *
 * WHAT IS GRADED HERE, and each cell is the observable consequence rather than the constant:
 *
 *   1. THE LOADER. A persona with `allowSubscribe: [ops]` and no `subscribe` LOADS. Under the old
 *      default it threw — the invented `general` read set was not within its own read ACL, so a
 *      perfectly coherent file was rejected by a channel it never named. That throw is the cell:
 *      it fails loud in exactly one direction, so it can be asserted without reading a private
 *      variable. `subscribe: [general]` still round-trips, so the seeded onboarding personas (which
 *      list it) are untouched.
 *
 *   2. THE CREDENTIAL, measured at the broker rather than read off the mint. An agent provisioned
 *      with no read set gets NO channel row: a native subscribe on `chat.*.*.general` is DENIED by
 *      nats-server. The mint is the wrong place to look — a JWT that lists no row and a broker that
 *      refuses the subscribe are different claims, and only the second one is the boundary.
 *
 *   3. THE REST OF THE CRED IS UNAFFECTED, which is the half that makes this safe. That same
 *      channel-less agent — provisioned with `allowPublish: []`, the empty-array form — still sends
 *      and receives DMs and still appears on the roster. "Default-deny for channels" must not
 *      quietly mean "default-deny for everything": an agent with no channel is a full mesh peer,
 *      just a quiet one.
 *
 *   4. THE SEND REFUSAL. With no concrete channel there is no default destination, so `multicast`
 *      with no explicit channel THROWS. The old code picked `general` here too, which for a scoped
 *      agent meant a broker denial, and for an open one meant a broadcast to a channel the caller
 *      never named. A refusal the caller can read beats both.
 *
 *   5. LEAVING YOUR LAST CHANNEL. Allowed, and always was — the `cotal_leave` tool description said
 *      "you can't leave your only channel", which was simply false (`leaveChannel` has no such
 *      guard). This walks it: on one channel, send works; leave it, send with no channel refuses;
 *      re-join, send works again. The description now says what this cell proves.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE: the connector's own env-level resolution (`configFromEnv`) is graded in its
 * own package, not here. This suite imports core by RELATIVE specifier (`../src/index.js`), so the
 * bytes it grades are the source you just edited, with no build in between.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:no-implicit-general   (needs `nats-server` on PATH; spins its own JWT-auth broker)
