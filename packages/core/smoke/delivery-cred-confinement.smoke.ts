/**
 * delivery cred confinement smoke (the security NO-GO guard for the delivery daemon, v3). Proves the
 * scoped `delivery` profile is least-privilege server-side infra, NOT allow-all:
 *  - sub.allow is ONLY its own `_INBOX` + the `ctl.delivery.*` control service it serves;
 *  - it has NO native subscription on the mixed pre-auth store (`dinbox.>`) or `chat.>` (a leaked cred
 *    can't sniff them directly — all its stream/KV reads ride the JS API);
 *  - it CANNOT post chat / spoof a peer, nor write the presence/ACL KVs;
 *  - it CAN write any owner's `dinbox`/`dlv` (fan-out + handoff) and ONLY its own lease key;
 *  - an AGENT cred can READ the lease bucket (Component 6 health) but CANNOT write the lease, and still
 *    cannot natively read `dinbox.>`.
 * The fan-out/reader create+consume ALLOW path is exercised end-to-end by the durable-delivery smokes
 * (running the daemon); this smoke is the DENY boundary.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:delivery-cred:auth   (needs `nats-server` on PATH; auth/JetStream, local-only)
