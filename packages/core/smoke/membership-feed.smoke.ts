/**
 * membership-feed smoke (the broker-sourced graph membership, end-to-end). Proves the derived feed is
 * AUTHORITATIVE and broker-sourced — it surfaces SILENT subscribers (zero traffic), the UNION across an
 * agent's connections, the merge of `live` (CONNZ) ∪ `durable` (members registry), excludes god-view
 * taps, and prunes a live subscriber when it disconnects while keeping its durable arm.
 *
 * Spins up a real auth broker, mints the two scoped membership creds, connects silent subscribers + an
 * admin god-tap, seeds a durable member, runs the core feed, and reads the derived bucket back.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:membership-feed:auth   (needs `nats-server` on PATH; auth/JetStream, local-only)
