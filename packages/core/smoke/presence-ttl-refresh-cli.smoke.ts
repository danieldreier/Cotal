/**
 * #286 — the TTL reconcile reaches a mesh that is ALREADY RUNNING, driven through the PUBLIC CLI.
 *
 * This suite exists because the sibling one was not enough, and the way it was not enough is the
 * lesson. `presence-ttl-migration-auth.smoke.ts` calls `setupSpaceStreams` DIRECTLY. It proves the
 * reconcile works; it never proves anything a user runs reaches it. It passed 15/15 while
 * `cotal up` against an already-running mesh returned success at `up.ts` WITHOUT reconciling
 * anything — because that branch returns before `postStart`, and `postStart` is the only CLI route
 * to `setupSpaceStreams`. So the fix was green, gated, and absent from the one deployment shape it
 * was written for: an old mesh, already up, whose buckets predate the TTLs.
 *
 * A drifted bucket only exists on a mesh that has been running since before the TTLs. Reconciling
 * only on the CREATE path repairs the deployments that never had the defect.
 *
 * So this drives the real binary twice with drift staged in between: `cotal up` → set `max_age: 0`
 * on all three TTL'd buckets → `cotal up` AGAIN from the same root and server → the TTLs must be
 * back. Nothing here calls the reconcile itself; if the public path stops reaching it, this reddens.
 *
 * Third invocation grades the steady state: a mesh already at the right TTLs must reconcile NOTHING
 * and say nothing, so a repeat `cotal up` does not become a write against a healthy production mesh.
 *
 * Needs `nats-server` on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:presence-ttl-refresh-cli
