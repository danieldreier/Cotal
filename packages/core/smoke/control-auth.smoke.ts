/**
 * Control-plane authz smoke (P2a/P5) — the transport boundary, verified at runtime.
 *
 * Spins up its OWN JWT-auth nats-server and proves nats-server — not a handler — enforces the
 * capability→command boundary on the v0.4 ep rails (the manager `ctl` tiers are DELETED, 1d):
 *   - non-capable agent: publish ep `spawn` request DENIED (holds only the Appendix-B baseline)
 *   - spawn-capable agent (capabilities:["spawn"]): ep `spawn` ALLOWED; any-mode `despawn` DENIED
 * The admin instrument set (any-mode despawn/attach + the manager.admin family) is minted only into
 * operator instrument creds — no agent cred, capable or not, holds it (default-deny by omission).
 * A denied publish rejects with an Authorization Violation; an allowed publish with no manager
 * running rejects with "No Responders" / timeout — the error type tells them apart. The full ep
 * grant matrix is manager-split-auth's job; this proves the boundary is broker-enforced.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:control-auth
