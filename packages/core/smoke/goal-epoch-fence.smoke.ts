/**
 * v0.4 §13.6 GOAL-TERMINAL ATTRIBUTION smoke — the item-3 acceptance gate, REWRITTEN.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE USED TO ASSERT, and why it was replaced. It encoded the epoch-scoped terminal
 * subject `…result.<execEpoch>`: one create-only subject per executor epoch, so a superseded
 * manager's terminal landed where no current reader looked. That mechanism was BOTH
 * non-conformant (SPEC §13.2 (reserved subjects) reserves the flat `goal.<cOwner>.<cActor>.<cUid>.<goalId>.result`
 * with no epoch token) AND actively wrong. It conflated two different jobs:
 *   - as a READ fence it produced WRONG ANSWERS. The window is "commit the terminal, then die
 *     before projecting it", where the pre-restart fact is the LEGITIMATE outcome, not a corpse's
 *     guess. Scoping by epoch hid that winner from every post-restart reader, made the crash
 *     reconciler throw instead of projecting, and then let the successor commit a SECOND,
 *     contradictory terminal on the new epoch's subject — the one callers actually read. A real
 *     `succeeded` was read back as `uncertain` for an agent that had genuinely spawned.
 *   - as a multi-manager WRITE fence it was load-bearing, which is why deleting it alone was not
 *     enough and this suite exists.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS NOW: one goal has ONE terminal subject, and every terminal is ATTRIBUTED, judged
 * against the goal's OWN accepted epoch and NEVER against the current one:
 *   - `committed == accepted` — the accepting executor answering for its own work. Valid FOREVER,
 *     however far the current epoch has advanced. This is the invariant the epoch subject lost.
 *   - `committed > accepted`  — a successor settling work it inherited. Valid.
 *   - `committed < accepted`  — impossible; refused as a garbled journal.
 *   - a half-attributed pair (epoch-bearing goal with an unattributed terminal, or a committer on
 *     a goal with no epoch context) is refused. There are no anonymous terminals.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES **NOT** PROVE, stated so no reader can mistake its scope. It is NOT a write
 * fence against a LIVE superseded committer. A corpse committing the terminal of a goal IT
 * accepted stamps `committed == accepted` and is accepted here, exactly as the true executor would
 * be — see the CORPSE case below, which asserts that indistinguishability rather than papering
 * over it. Create-only CAS conditions on subject ABSENCE and cannot express "only if my epoch is
 * still current", so the write fence is the §13.1 takeover barrier.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL IS WIDER THAN "BYTES IN FLIGHT", and this suite says so because an earlier draft of
 * it got this wrong. A gate FREEZE neither kills the predecessor's connection nor advances the
 * epoch, and the currency belt compares `processEpoch` alone, so a deposed manager's belt STILL
 * PASSES from barrier start through PHASE 1-2 until the reopen. Revoking an `epcred` row marks a
 * ledger row; it does not re-check a live JWT mid-publish on an already-open connection. The
 * durable death of that publisher is the CLUSTER-VERIFIED EVICTION in PHASE 2, not the revoke. So
 * a deposed manager can still INITIATE new terminal publishes from barrier start until eviction is
 * verified. On an OPEN mesh no credential family exists, so that eviction is vacuous and there is
 * no durable fence at all — the belt there is cooperative only. The named follow-up that would
 * close this is the gate-linearized commit (routing the terminal through the issuance gate's own
 * CAS); it is deliberately deferred as substrate/item-3 territory.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:goal-epoch-fence   (needs nats-server on PATH; part of smoke:ci)
