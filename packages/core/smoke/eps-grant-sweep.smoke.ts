/**
 * EPS GRANT SWEEP (control-surface v0.4, Lane B finding 1) — the STRUCTURAL guard behind
 * SPEC §13.9: "both sides of a session hold only redemption-minted per-session credentials
 * (§13.6); no standing EPS grant exists on either side", and the §13.9 matrix rows at 2695-2698
 * which require the EXACT `eps.<endpoint>.<sessionId>.<epoch>.{in,out}` subject on all four legs.
 *
 * The suite this replaces encoded BOTH the rule and its violation and was green on both:
 * `ep-session` asserted no standing EPS while `session-writer-grant` pinned the wildcard
 * `eps.<endpoint>.*.<epoch>.{in,out}` as reviewed literals. Flipping that one assertion would
 * leave the contradiction reintroducible by the next profile. So this sweep does not inspect the
 * profile under change; it enumerates EVERY mint profile and asks a question no wording can dodge:
 *
 *     can this credential touch a session rail that is not its own?
 *
 * It answers by NATS SUBJECT MATCHING, not string search. Each profile's rows are matched against
 * a foreign session's `in` and `out` rails with real wildcard semantics (`*` = one token, `>` =
 * the rest), so `eps.<e>.*.<epoch>.in`, `eps.>`, `cotal.<space>.>` and a bare `>` are all caught
 * by the same check, and a future row shape nobody anticipated is caught too.
 *
 * EXHAUSTIVENESS IS ENFORCED, NOT DECLARED. The producer table is keyed `Record<Profile, …>`, so
 * the compiler refuses a missing profile where this file is typechecked, and — because smoke files
 * are not in the typecheck project — the sweep ALSO proves at runtime that its key set is exactly
 * the profile set of `CREDENTIAL_LIFETIMES` (the frozen D5 table every profile must classify into).
 * A profile the sweep cannot construct FAILS; there is no skip list, because a skipped profile is
 * an escaped profile. `endpoint-serve` is deliberately unconstructible through `permissionsFor`
 * (its rows are emitted only by `mintCreds` behind the §13.1 issuance fence), so the table reaches
 * it through the SAME row builder that mint uses rather than skipping it.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:eps-grant-sweep   (broker-free; part of smoke:ci).
