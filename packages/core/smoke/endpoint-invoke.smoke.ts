/**
 * GENERIC describe/invoke REQUEST-BINDING smoke (control-surface P2 item 1, 1c.2c hardening) —
 * proves {@link describeEndpoint} binds its reply to the request it sent, so the describe-derived
 * invoke currency cannot be captured by an injected reply (freelance cold-review HIGH #1).
 *
 * The responder grant `epResponderReplyPattern` spans EVERY caller-nonce suffix, so any live
 * responder can publish on a caller's reply rail at any nonce. A describe that accepted the first
 * `{ok:true}` on the rail (no nonce match, no request-id echo) would adopt an ATTACKER-chosen
 * responder identity + epoch as "current", defeating the whole describe-bound currency check.
 *
 * Hermetic: a fake NatsConnection captures the subscription callback and, on publish, reads the
 * outgoing request's nonce + id off the subject/body and synchronously delivers crafted replies.
 * No broker. Run: pnpm smoke:ep-invoke
