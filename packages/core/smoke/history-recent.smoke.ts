/**
 * `channelHistory` / `dmHistory` must return the MOST RECENT messages.
 *
 * They used to return the oldest. `js.consumers.get(stream, {...})` builds an ordered consumer that
 * defaults to `opt_start_seq: 1`, so capping the fetch at `limit` took the first N messages ever
 * sent, while the API is documented as "recent" and every caller renders it as the latest. On any
 * channel busier than one page, the dashboard and the agent history tools showed the beginning of
 * the conversation.
 *
 * Also asserted here: reading one page must not cost the whole backlog in transfer, since that is
 * the other half of why history was slow on a remote mesh.
 *
 * Needs nats-server on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:history-recent
