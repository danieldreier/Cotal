/**
 * The config layering behind `spawn.env`, exercised through `loadCotalConfig` rather than through
 * the merge function it calls.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `spawn` is the first top-level config key besides `connectors`, and adding it
 * uncovered that `mergeConfig` returned `{ connectors }` - so every other top-level key a config
 * file declared was silently discarded on the way through. That was latent rather than harmful only
 * because no such key existed yet. Nothing anywhere referenced `loadCotalConfig`, `mergeConfig` or
 * `spawnEnvAllow`, so the layering path had no coverage at the moment it acquired its first real
 * user, and the fix for the discard had none either.
 *
 * WHY THROUGH `loadCotalConfig`. `mergeConfig` is not exported, and testing a merge by calling it
 * directly would prove the merge works without proving the loader reaches it. These cells write real
 * files to the two real paths and read the result back through the function the CLI and the manager
 * actually call.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:spawn-env-config
