 * publication, NO age eviction (artifacts are permanent). allow_direct: the subject-scoped
 * last-by-subject read IS the fetch path.
 *
 * PER-SUBJECT IMMUTABILITY is BROKER-ENFORCED, not left to publisher cooperation (the append-shadow
 * blocker, live-confirmed by the panel). The create-only fence `Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence:
 * 0` is a publisher-SET header the `epc.*` publish grant cannot compel, so a non-cooperative
 * grant-holder could APPEND a second message to an already-published digest subject; `last_by_subj`
 * would then return that shadow and a fail-closed read would make the honest artifact permanently
 * unfetchable (deny_delete/deny_purge block recovery — an operator-reprovision-only DoS, and at
 * §13.11's ep-only cut the SOLE contract path). The store closes this at the SOURCE:
 * `max_msgs_per_subject: 1` + `discard: new` + `discard_new_per_subject: true` makes a second
 * publish to an occupied digest subject BROKER-REJECTED (err 10077) regardless of headers, so a
 * digest subject holds exactly one message forever. `deny_delete`/`deny_purge` then keep that one
 * message from being removed. (The read path additionally defends itself version-agnostically —
 * {@link fetchContractArtifact} prefers the create-only winner over any shadow — so a broker or a
 * legacy stream that lacked the per-subject cap is still safe.)
 *
 * Create-or-verify-AND-harden, safe at every authority-daemon boot (the {@link
 * ensureAuthorityStores} discipline): a fresh space gets the store created with the full shape; a
 * CLEAN pre-existing store (incl. a pre-hardening one from an earlier release, OR the config-A
 * footgun `max_msgs_per_subject:1` + `discard:old` that would DELETE the honest artifact) is UPDATED
 * to the three config-B flags (idempotent, like the records store's rollup/deny update) and then
 * VERIFIED - a shape that cannot be brought to config B FAILS LOUD, never silently adopted.
 *
 * The config-B upgrade ENFORCES per-subject immutability GOING FORWARD; it does NOT heal a shadow
 * that predates it. Applying `max_msgs_per_subject:1` trims each subject to its newest message, so a
 * legacy store that ALREADY holds a shadow (some digest subject with >1 message) would have the
 * honest create-only winner trimmed away and the shadow cemented. Rather than silently cement it,
 * the upgrade REFUSES LOUD on such a store (`messages > num_subjects`), so the operator reprovisions
 * a clean store. This is a narrow guard: a fresh deploy is born at config B and never reaches it.
 *
 * FAIL-LOUD IS THE AGENT'S DEFENSE (critic completeness item): because this verify refuses to serve
 * unless all three config-B flags are present, the manager NEVER serves an un-hardened EPC store —
 * so a shadow-append cannot exist on any store an agent reads. That is why the ordinary agent
 * baseline needs only the subject-scoped `last_by_subj` read (never the bare `next_by_subj` the
 * shadow fallback uses): on every store the manager actually serves, `last_by_subj` always verifies
 * and the fallback never triggers. The {@link fetchContractArtifact} create-only-winner fallback is
 * defense-in-depth for the publisher path (the executor, which holds `next_by_subj`) and for a
 * hypothetical un-hardened store the manager would refuse to serve anyway. On the pinned broker
 * floor (nats-server >= 2.12, well past the 2.9 that added `discard_new_per_subject`) config B always
 * lands; an older broker that ignores the flag is caught here and the daemon fails to start.

/** The manager's SESSION-LEDGER rows (P2 item 6): the standing connection that owns the §13.6
 *  session ledger and NOTHING else. It holds NO session rail — not the wildcard it used to hold,
 *  not an exact one. That is the whole point of the split.
 *
 *  §13.6 gives the ledger a job the byte rails do not have: it is "a DURABLE named authority that
 *  survives the serving endpoint", the thing that still knows what to revoke after the endpoint
 *  serving a session is gone. So it is standing and renewable, while the rails it records are
 *  per-session, exact-subject, and die with their session ({@link import("./provision.js").Profile}
 *  `session-serving` / `session-caller`). An earlier revision fused the two into one standing
 *  credential carrying `eps.<endpoint>.*.<epoch>.{in,out}`, which contradicted §13.9:2753 ("no
 *  standing EPS grant exists on either side") and let one credential read and write every live
 *  session's bytes at that epoch. Splitting on the lifetime boundary is what removes the wildcard:
 *  the standing half no longer has rails to widen.
 *
 *  Its store is the DEDICATED {@link sessionsBucket}, NOT the auth bucket. The write is
 *  `$KV.<sessions>.session.*` (create-only CAS + revision-pinned update; `sessionLedgerKey` is the
 *  single-token `session.<id>`). The read is a bucket-blind leader `STREAM.MSG.GET` (allow_direct=
 *  false, so `kv.get` is a body-selected read that cannot be key-pinned) — but the dedicated bucket
 *  holds ONLY `session.>` rows, so that blind read exposes nothing but session ledger state,
 *  structurally closing the §13.9 subject-blindness the auth bucket carries (creds + gates). The
 *  reply inbox is connection-scoped. NO auth-bucket, records-bucket, or messaging-plane grant.
 *
 *  NAMED RESIDUAL: `session.*` is one token wide and carries no endpoint component, because a
 *  `sessionId` is an opaque unguessable token with no endpoint inside it. So this credential can
 *  read and CAS any session row in its space, including another endpoint's. That was equally true
 *  of the credential it replaces; it is not a regression, and it is confined to ledger STATE — row
 *  state and credential ids — never to session bytes, which now require a per-session credential
 *  this profile cannot mint. */

 *  §13.7 — the grant cannot express it, the broker CAS enforces it) and the subject-confined
 *  follower read-back `DIRECT.GET.EPC_<space>.cotal.<space>.epc.>` (NON-fencing by design:
 *  artifacts are content-addressed and verify-on-read is the tamper boundary, §13.7, so a
 *  stale replica serves nothing forgeable). NO `STREAM.INFO`: the deny_delete/deny_purge shape
 *  proof is the provisioner's (§13.12), not this profile's. The reply inbox is
 *  connection-scoped (`_INBOX_<connId>.>`, never the account-wide default).
 *
 *  D32 residuals, EXPLICIT: (1) the `epc.*` publish is payload-blind — a compromised publisher
 *  can publish garbage artifacts at NEW (previously-unused) digest subjects (verify-on-read refuses
 *  to SERVE non-canonical or digest-mismatched bytes, so this is a bounded storage flood carrying
 *  no authority). It can NOT overwrite, shadow, or replace an EXISTING published artifact: the EPC
 *  store's shape ({@link ensureContractStore}: `max_msgs_per_subject:1` + discard-new-per-subject)
 *  makes a second publish to an occupied digest subject broker-REJECTED regardless of the
 *  create-only header, so per-subject immutability is broker-enforced, not publisher-cooperative.
 *  (Earlier revisions relied on the cooperative create-only header alone and a fail-closed read,
 *  which the panel's live repro showed a non-cooperative publisher could defeat by raw append — a
 *  permanent shadow-DoS; the stream shape + the create-only-winner read fallback close it.) (2) the
 *  raw JS API request carries a caller-selected reply subject (the same confused-deputy injection
 *  class as every API-holding profile). */
