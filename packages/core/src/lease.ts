/**
 * Delivery-daemon single-flight lease — a CAS-guarded key in the per-space `cotal_delivery_<space>` KV
 * bucket. One key per shard ({@link leaseKey}); the holder is the live delivery daemon for that shard.
 * Acquire is an ATOMIC `kv.create` (fails if a live lease exists) — a loud refusal-to-bind, so two
 * daemons never split a durable's delivery. The bucket has a bucket-level TTL ({@link LEASE_TTL_MS}),
 * so a CRASHED holder's lease key auto-expires and a fresh daemon can re-acquire; the holder renews
 * (CAS `kv.update`) at ~half the TTL to stay alive. The same key is the daemon-readiness signal and
 * the non-gating `cotal_channels` delivery-health signal (READ-ONLY for an agent — Component 6).
 *
 * The acquire/renew/release/read operations live as methods on {@link CotalEndpoint} (they reuse its
 * connection + cred); this module is just the bucket-open helper + the record shape, mirroring
 * `openMembersRegistry` / `openAclRegistry`.
