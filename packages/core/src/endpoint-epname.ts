/**
 * `epname` — the durable name claim (SPEC §13.4; the closed machine).
 *
 * A name is an identity that outlives the process holding it. The row answers three questions that
 * a live process cannot answer about itself: who holds this name, which lifecycle it names, and
 * WHICH INCARNATION owns the handle table for it. The third is the one that keeps being got wrong,
 * because it is the only one whose answer is invisible from the row's own subject.
 *
 * TWO RULES THAT COST MORE THAN THEY LOOK.
 *
 * `runtimeOwner` IS MOVED, NOT DERIVED. It is written from the executor that made the spawn call,
 * recorded at the moment it becomes true rather than reconstructed later. It MOVES on the FOUR
 * edges that resolve a launch — `launching → live`, `relaunching → live`, `launching → draining`,
 * `relaunching → draining` — taking the full incarnation and clearing `launchAttemptId`; and it is
 * CARRIED unchanged on the THREE edges that do not: `live → preserved`, `live → draining`,
 * `preserved → draining`. The one creation edge into `live` is the cutover backfill, which
 * INSTALLS it from the incumbent's own live gate row and records a CASUALTY when it cannot read
 * one, there being no previous row to carry from.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS PARAGRAPH SAID "written at `launching → live` … and every subsequent edge CARRIES it",
 * which was true of a simpler machine than the one below it. It named ONE move edge where four
 * ship, and said CARRIES of two edges that MOVE: `relaunching → live` and `relaunching → draining`
 * are both reached only after `live`, so they ARE subsequent, and both take a new owner. A reader
 * who implemented from it would move the owner once and carry it through a relaunch, which is a
 * different machine. Rebound to the edge table rather than argued with.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS VERY PARAGRAPH GOT ITS OWN DIAGNOSIS WRONG, which is worth
 * leaving visible. It said the old wording "over-includes the creation edge". It does not:
 * `— → live` is not SUBSEQUENT to `launching → live`, it is an alternative path to the same state.
 * The sentence that over-included the creation edge was a later one, corrected separately. I had
 * taken a true diagnosis of a neighbouring sentence and applied it to this one because they were
 * about the same field. A reviewer caught it.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE SECOND VERSION MADE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN, one sentence after correcting it. It
 * listed `launching → draining` among the edges the old wording claimed CARRIES. It is not
 * subsequent to `launching → live` either: it is a sibling exit from `launching`, exactly the
 * shape the paragraph above had just finished granting to `— → live`. The same reviewer caught
 * that too. Three generations of this paragraph, two of them wrong in the same way, which is the
 * argument for reading the edge table rather than reasoning about the prose.
 *
 * It is deliberately never re-derived from a slot row,
 * because user mode has no slot row at all, so a derivation is unevaluable on a supported path,
 * and an unevaluable predicate is one that either refuses forever or falls back to absence.
 * `instanceId` alone will not do: an identity is not an incarnation, and a restarted process with
 * the same id has an empty handle table, which is the absence of knowledge rather than knowledge
 * of absence.
 *
 * `draining` HAS EXACTLY ONE EXIT, AND IT IS THE OPERATOR. The ordinary edge required its actor to
 * be the row's `runtimeOwner` attesting that the runtime is gone. That actor cannot exist: an owner
 * still alive has no queryable per-attempt handle to attest about, and a restarted one is a
 * different incarnation. The edge was satisfiable only by the party least entitled to satisfy it,
 * so it is removed rather than weakened — and `draining` is a state an operator clears by hand
 * until a durable runtime-attempt token exists. That cost is real and is recorded rather than
 * hidden inside a predicate that reads as satisfiable.
