/**
 * v0.4 caller-side verbs (SPEC §13.5 "Verbs", §13.2 rails, §13.3 envelope) — call, cast, watch,

 * call and a cast publish the same request form; the verb rides `replyExpected`, and only the
 * §13.5 gather semantics differ.
 *
 * Boundary discipline mirrors the serve side: args validate against the COMPILED input contract
 * before publish (a caller never emits a request its own contract refuses), the pinned
 * invocation digests are DERIVED from each contract's closure digest, and every consumed reply
 * or event is runtime-validated at this, its consuming boundary (§13.3) — subject-attributed
 * (instance + epoch from the SUBJECT, never the body), id-echoed, and schema-checked under the
 * same fixed §13.8 budget the responder ran. Journal-class work never rides these rails: the
 * verbs pin `class: "ephemeral"`; submissions go through the `epj` journal machinery (§13.4).

 * a failed reply subscription is `unavailable`, never fabricated member silence.
 *
 * CLASSIFICATION LINEARIZES AT THE GATHER DEADLINE. The classification point T is `min(all frozen
 * slots answered-valid, deadline)`; `missing` is fixed at T (from the `respondedAtDeadline` snapshot).
 * The `lateDrainMs` window runs AFTER T on an ABSOLUTE clock — the rail is closed exactly `lateDrainMs`
 * after T regardless of how long the reconcile takes, so late classification cannot leak past the
 * requested horizon. It is OBSERVATIONAL only: it may add to `late`/`duplicate`, never move
 * `missing`/`churn`/`complete`. With `lateDrainMs` omitted the rail closes at T (no `late`).
 *
 * WHOLE-OPERATION BUDGET. The op is bounded: the gather to T comes FIRST, then a post-T phase in which
 * the reconcile and the drain run CONCURRENTLY (the drain is armed at T, before the reconcile await).
 * So worst-case wall-clock ≈ `deadlineMs` (gather) + `max(reconcileDeadlineMs, lateDrainMs)` (post-T),
 * NOT their sum. The reconcile is a bounded read taken SHORTLY AFTER T (not a zero-width at-T snapshot):
 * a true instant-of-T revision would need a watch/frontier, so a re-registration strictly concurrent
 * with the bounded read is an inherent, documented window (recorded for the §13.5 SPEC reconciliation).
 *
 * Two §13.5 signals are not on the reply rail, so the caller supplies them as HOOKS (keeping the verb
 * free of storage coupling; the §13.9 read grant stays with the caller, and a caller-read revision is
 * more trustworthy than a responder-stamped one):
 *  - `reconcileRegistration` (REQUIRED): reads EVERY frozen slot's CURRENT state after the classification
 *    point, returning a per-instance `EpRegistrationState` verdict. A slot still registered at a revision
 *    ADVANCED past its frozen one is `churn` ("registration") and uncounted (a re-registration advances
 *    registrationRevision WITHOUT advancing the epoch, so the reply rail cannot see it). A slot the read
 *    observed as GONE (`{ registered: false }`) is an explicit mid-scatter deregistration: NOT churn, and
 *    a valid reply it already gave still counts (a plain departure does not invalidate the reply the way
 *    a re-registration would). Its result is COMPLETENESS-validated: a frozen id ABSENT from the returned
 *    Map is an incomplete read (`failed-precondition`) — distinct from an explicit `{ registered: false }`
 *    verdict — a non-integer/non-positive revision is a garbled read (`failed-precondition`), and a
 *    revision BELOW the frozen one is a non-monotonic/buggy read (`failed-precondition`); otherwise a
 *    partial hook would silently preserve the old full-triple over-claim. It is BOUNDED by
 *    `reconcileDeadlineMs`: a never-settling read is `unavailable`, never a hung scatter (SPEC 13.5:
 *    deadline mandatory); an unreadable registry is `failed-precondition`. Authoritative `complete`
 *    requires it.
 *  - `reconcileDeadlineMs` (optional, default `deadlineMs`): the explicit bound on that post-T read,
 *    named so the single `deadlineMs` is not silently spent twice.
 *  - `lateDrainMs` (optional): the absolute post-T horizon for `late` classification. Omitted → none.
 *  - `probeLiveness` (optional): affirmative per-instance liveness, run concurrently with the gather.
 *    The gather's only exits are "every frozen slot answered" and the deadline, so a slot that CANNOT
 *    answer makes the first unreachable and the deadline is paid in full — every scatter in the space,
 *    forever, because the registry has no expiry and a crashed instance never deregisters. This hook
 *    supplies the missing fact. It moves the classification point T EARLIER and moves NOTHING else:
 *    a slot the broker affirms is gone is still `missing`, still surfaced, still not `complete`.
 *    ONLY the verdict `gone` licenses anything; `live`, `unknown`, a throwing hook, and any value
 *    outside the closed set all license nothing and leave the full deadline standing. That asymmetry
 *    is deliberate and is the safety argument: a broken or lying-quiet probe degrades to exactly
 *    today's behavior, never to a fast wrong answer.
