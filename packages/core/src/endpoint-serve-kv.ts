 * This module is the raw-KV credential-ledger primitives + the endpoint-serve mint fence + the

 *  family (the manager's goal-writer and its §13.6 session credentials): the family IS the
 *  takeover/retirement barrier's revocation unit, so a sibling that joins it without the fence is a
 *  credential the barrier can never revoke.
 *
 *  THE PASSED-IN OBSERVATION IS THE AUTHORITY AND IS NEVER REPLACED BY A RE-READ. A sibling's grant
 *  is built FROM the observed coordinates (the serving epoch above all), so what this commit must
 *  fence is the gate the credential was MINTED against. Fencing whatever the gate says NOW would be
 *  the hole: the dangerous case is not a frozen gate but a COMPLETED takeover — freeze →
 *  revoke/evict → reopen leaves the gate `open` again at a NEW generation, so a mint that re-pinned
 *  to the successor would win its CAS and release a JWT minted against the PREDECESSOR's coordinates
 *  into the family the barrier has just finished reconciling. This function re-reads the gate ONLY
 *  to CLASSIFY a lost CAS, and every field of that re-read is compared against the ORIGINAL
 *  observation: a successor coordinate can therefore never be adopted, it can only be refused.
 *
 *  Order, identical to the serve mint: require `open` -> stage the row -> revision-pinned commit ->
 *  release ONLY on the win. A frozen gate refuses before anything is written; a gate that MOVED
 *  between the caller's observe and this commit loses the CAS, and the staged row is revoked so no
 *  active row is left in a family the barrier already enumerated. A revoke failure is surfaced, not
 *  swallowed — the reconciliation debt must be visible. The caller releases the credential only if
