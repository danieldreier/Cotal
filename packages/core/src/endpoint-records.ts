 * LOUD `conflict` the caller re-reads and re-decides (§13.8) — deliberately unlike the ACL
 * registry's internal retry, because record writers are fenced principals whose lost CAS is a
 * decision point, never a last-writer-wins policy.
 *
 * These are the primitives the mediated writer principals (§13.9) build on; nothing here grants
 * anything. Untrusted callers never hold raw reads on this bucket — their reads ride the

 *  first merged view is yielded when the replay completes, and every later delta re-yields the
 *  merged view. A watcher that errors, ends, or observes a status ahead of its cached spec
 *  (impossible from honest writers in an unbroken ordered watch) RESYNCS with a fresh consumer
 *  — a fresh full snapshot, duplicates tolerated, never a patch across a gap.
 *
 *  Resyncs are budgeted on CONSECUTIVE no-progress incarnations, reset once an incarnation
 *  delivers at least one ordered post-snapshot delta (a lifetime-cumulative budget would kill a
 *  long-lived watch on accumulated benign blips; a snapshot alone must not count as progress or
 *  an immediately-ending iterator would spin forever). Ends when the spec key is deleted (the
 *  record is retired — a watch started on an already-retired record ends immediately) or when
