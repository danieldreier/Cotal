// the stream is mute and the launch that armed it reports success. So the mismatch is named at
// grant/spawn time, where it is still fixable, rather than discovered later as silence.
//
// The question asked is INTERSECTION, not containment: "does this grant match any principal-keyed

// owner-wide grant the two-token key exists to make expressible.

 *  owner/actor tokens ban) and the verdict is delegated to {@link subjectMatches}, the shipped
 *  matcher the broker's rule is expressed in. The prefix and arity are read off a probe built by
 *  `channelFor` itself, so nothing here names a particular namespace.
 *
 *  Returning the witness rather than a boolean is what makes the refusal explainable: a caller can
 *  show an operator a subject their grant WOULD have covered, or state that none exists.
 *
 *  DEEPER-THAN-PRINCIPAL PATTERNS YIELD NO WITNESS. A grant naming more tokens than the principal key
 *  (a per-session sub-channel, say) matches no principal-keyed channel, so it is reported mute here
