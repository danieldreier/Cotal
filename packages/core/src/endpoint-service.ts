 *  under the frozen gate, revoke + VERIFIED-evict the superseded credential family, THEN advance
 *  the spec, then reopen at the successor `registrationRevision`. Old authority dies before new
 *  authority is published. This is REQUIRED, not documented: core exports no bare spec-key advance
 *  that could leave a mint's observed `registrationRevision` permanently equal to its snapshot,
 *  win a never-frozen CAS, and silently release a superseded-surface credential. The gate is
 *  created by the provisioner at instance mint (D13); a missing gate is `failed-precondition`. The
 *  production `barrier` wires to the durable KV CAS (D13/D14); the D4 seam is the typed protocol

 *      the superseded N still equals the stored epoch (§13.9);
 *   3. a below-stored epoch is `conflict` (§13.9), distinct from the mapping fence.
 *  `readProcessEpoch` is the trusted mapping-reader seam (leader-served, §13.9; the D13
 *  lifecycle registry provides the production reader). The racing CAS loss is a loud `conflict`.
 *  `expectedStatusRevision` pins the CAS to the CALLER's observed status revision (0 = observed

 * expires a row. An instance whose host dies leaves a record that claims a live state forever, and
 * every class scatter in the space then freezes that slot in and waits out the full deadline for an
 * answer that can never come. Registration therefore needs a way OUT that does not depend on the
 * dead instance's cooperation, and this is it. There is deliberately no automatic sweep behind it:
 * the two callers are an instance removing its OWN row on a clean stop, and an operator naming a
 * hard-dead instance explicitly.
 *
 * ORDER IS PART OF THE CONTRACT: status first, then spec. A reader that catches the pair mid-delete
 * sees "spec without status", which §13.4 already defines (an instance registered but not converged;
 * {@link freezeExpectedSet} skips it) and which {@link readRecord} reads cleanly. The other order
 * produces "status without spec", which is the TORN state readers refuse — a deregistration would
 * hand every concurrent reader a `failed-precondition` for the width of one round trip.
 *
 * BOTH DELETES ARE REVISION-PINNED to what this function just read. A blind delete of a registration
 * is a delete of whatever is there NOW, and what is there now may be a successor that re-registered
 * microseconds ago under the same instanceId — exactly the case a restart produces. A moved key
 * aborts with `superseded` and removes nothing.
 *
 * THE RECOVERY PATH, because a deregistration must never be a one-way door: the record is removed,
 * the §13.1 issuance gate is NOT. The same instance can register again and does so on its next
 * start — {@link registerServiceInstance} writes over the tombstone under a revision-pinned CAS and
 * advances the epoch as it does for any other restart.
