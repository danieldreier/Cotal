 * and invoke a named command — WITHOUT the caller compiling the endpoint's schemas ahead of time.
 * This is what a `cotal describe`/`cotal invoke` CLI and every migrated control consumer ride, so
 * a consumer no longer hand-imports the manager's contract module.
 *
 * The trust chain is the §13.7 one, end to end:
 *  - `describe` (the reserved, authorization-scoped command every endpoint serves) answers the
 *    caller's VISIBLE command set + the registered CLUSTER closure digests;
 *  - each cluster document is fetched from the store at its closure digest and VERIFIED
 *    (two-stage manifest→root, content-addressed) — the command's input/output CLOSURE digests
 *    come from those verified bytes, never a caller assertion;
 *  - each schema closure is fetched + PROFILE-recompiled; the recompiled contract's closureDigest
 *    MUST equal the registered digest (a store that served the wrong bytes fails here);
 *  - the invoke pins those digests, so the responder's digest-bound serve boundary honors exactly
 *    the schema the caller validated against.

 *  terminal here. The subscription opens BEFORE `submit` runs (a fast join could terminalize within
 *  milliseconds of the acceptance), buffering terminals by goalId. The reply is then RESOLVED from
 *  the terminal: `succeeded` → the terminal's data (today's live reply — name/id/role/agent/mode/
 *  lifecycleUid), `failed`/`uncertain`/`cancelled` → a non-ok reply carrying the cause. A reply with
 *  NO goalId (a refuse-at-accept, or a non-action command) passes through unchanged. UX is preserved:
 *  the call still returns on the real outcome. The caller needs the per-goal progress read row
