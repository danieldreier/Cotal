/**
 * The one extension kind an identity/auth implementation registers so a composition root can turn
 * on USER-MODE auth (the human-owner identity plane over per-agent NATS identity) WITHOUT importing
 * that implementation. `@cotal-ai/auth` self-registers one on import; the `cotal` binary pulls the
 * package in, and the CLI resolves it generically (`registry.all<AuthProvider>("auth-provider")`).
 *
 * Guarded core: this seam is IdP-agnostic and knows nothing about callouts, bearers, ledgers, or
 * any concrete IdP. It exchanges a NARROW provisioning input (exactly the signing material the
 * provider's function requires — never the whole space trust bundle) for the operator-signed
 * accounts the broker config preloads, plus opaque client metadata and a service handle. All
 * auth-specific substance stays behind these types.
 *
 * No provider registered ⇒ user-mode auth is unavailable and requesting it MUST fail loud (no
 * static fallback) — a library root that never imports the auth package simply cannot serve a
 * user-auth space.
 *
 * TWO state surfaces, split by the {@link SecretStore} seam: the provider's SECRET material
 * (callout account, issuer keys, owner secret, service key projection) rides the `store` each
 * method receives — the CALLER composes it (locally the workspace's `.cotal`-rooted filesystem
 * store; a hosted composition injects KMS/Vault), the provider never discovers one ambiently.
 * The provider's NON-SEAM state (the actor ledger, the IdP pin, service runtime discovery)
 * stays under `dir`, the local state directory.
