/**
 * The ACTION composite (SPEC §13.6): a long-running command as a pattern over the journal +
 * records + events — zero new transport. `action` is a command MARKER, never a class: an
 * action's submissions are `class: journal`, its accept/reject is the durable decision fact
 * (§13.4), and there is no reply-rail answer to recover.
 *
 * THE RESULT FACT IS THE SINGLE TERMINAL ARBITER; THE STATUS ONLY EVER FOLLOWS IT, and every
 * authority coordinate is bound to the PERSISTED accepted goal, never a caller claim. The
 * pieces, each owned by the §13.9 principal named on its row:
 *  - the GOAL BIND (canonicalizer): a create-only CAS on
 *    `epf.<e>.goal.<caller triple>.<goalId>.bind` carrying the accepted fingerprint, BEFORE
 *    acceptance — the bind keys on `goalId` and stops a second distinct submission before
 *    acceptance and effect. A bind whose winner crashed BEFORE acceptance (no goal record) is
 *    ORPHANED, and a same-fingerprint resubmission ADOPTS it ({@link resolveGoalSubmission}).
 *  - the GOAL RECORD (commit path): `goal.<e>.<caller triple>.<goalId>` spec (the accepted
 *    definition — the trusted source every later seam validates against) + status (the CURRENT
 *    state projection). The status vocabulary is `accepted → running ⇄ waiting → terminal`,
 *    `cancelling` between a cancel and its terminal. A TERMINAL status exists ONLY as the
 *    projection of the committed result fact ({@link projectGoalTerminal}); {@link
 *    transitionGoal} refuses terminal targets, so the status never leads the journal. Every
 *    EXECUTOR-authored transition on a TARGET-PINNED goal proves the executor's fresh
 *    lifecycle/epoch currency (§13.6 item 7: a superseded epoch cannot commit transitions).
 *  - the TERMINAL RESULT (commit path): a create-only CAS on
 *    `epf.<e>.goal.<caller triple>.<goalId>.result` — the ONE commit point where completion,
 *    cancel, expiry-deny, and the readiness `uncertain` settle race, first terminal fact wins
 *    uniformly. The raw CAS is PRIVATE; the public commit takes a CLOSED CAUSE whose
 *    authoritative predicate is verified INSIDE the boundary (a `complete` proves executor
 *    currency, a `cancel` proves the goal is `cancelling`, a `readiness` proves the deadline
 *    passed) and DERIVES the terminal state from the cause — a raw state is never accepted.
 *  - the TOMBSTONE (§13.6 item 5): the summary lives INSIDE the one immutable result fact;
 *    retaining the fact the full idempotency horizon satisfies both retention minimums, and
 *    early payload eviction is a serving-layer policy answered with {@link goalTombstone}.
 *  - PROGRESS rides per-goal events, read-scoped to the caller at mint time.
 *
 * Every seam takes a BRANDED {@link ActionContext} bonding the record store + fact stream +
 * space, so a composition mixup cannot read an accepted spec from space A and project through
 * space B. Clocks are inputs everywhere (`now`, `acceptedAt`): the owner's clock decides.
