 *  bucket's config, so a presence/lease bucket created by a cotal that predated the TTL (or created
 *  without it) keeps NO expiry forever — dead presence records and stale leases never age out, and a
 *  raw-KV reader (a dashboard) shows a crashed agent as live indefinitely. Run at every `cotal up`, this
 *  `STREAM.UPDATE`s the backing stream when its `max_age` has drifted. Lowering `max_age` immediately
 *  ages out already-expired messages (the intended liveness effect; active leases are younger than their
 *  TTL and survive, a stale one dies and its holder self-fences on its next failed renewal). NATS requires
 *  `duplicate_window <= max_age`; an old unlimited bucket's 120s window would otherwise reject the update,
 *  so the window is lowered in the SAME update. Idempotent (a matching bucket is skipped). The `provisioner`
 *  cred holds `STREAM.UPDATE` on exactly these three streams (see provision.ts).
 *
 *  WHAT THE READ-BACK PROVES, AND WHAT IT CANNOT. It verifies exactly two things: **`max_age` came back
 *  EXACTLY as intended**, and **`duplicate_window` does not violate the NATS constraint** (it is not
 *  above `max_age`). A no-op update, a `max_age` that came back other than intended, or a server that
 *  answers OK without changing anything is caught here and throws.
 *
 *  Note what that does NOT include: the update sends a computed `dupNs`, but the read-back never checks
 *  the window came back as sent — omitted, zeroed, or clamped smaller all pass. Deliberate: any window
 *  `<= max_age` is legal and harmless for a liveness bucket, and demanding equality would turn a
 *  legitimate server-side clamp into a failed `cotal up`. (Confirmed by probe: the real function accepts
 *  a read-back with exact `max_age` and the window OMITTED.) It does NOT prove that file-store expiry is
 *  in force either, and the distinction is
 *  not theoretical — on the supported floor (nats-server 2.12.1) the effect is applied in two places and
 *  only one of them is visible to us:
 *    - `stream.go` assigns the new in-memory `mset.cfg`, then calls `mset.store.UpdateConfig(cfg)` and
 *      IGNORES its returned error;
 *    - `filestore.go`'s `UpdateConfig` restores the previous config and returns early when
 *      `writeStreamMeta()` fails — BEFORE `expireMsgs()`/age enforcement is ever started;
 *    - `STREAM.INFO` is answered from `mset.config()`, i.e. the in-memory copy.
 *  So a metadata-write fault (EACCES, ENOSPC) yields UPDATE OK, a read-back showing the intended
 *  `max_age`, and a backing store still running unlimited with no expiry timer. **This check cannot see
 *  that**, because both fields it reads come from the config that DID get updated.
 *
 *  It is NOT, however, invisible everywhere — an earlier version of this comment said no check at this
 *  seam could see it, and that was false. `$JS.API.STREAM.SNAPSHOT` splits the useful way: the snapshot
 *  INITIATION response copies `mset.config()` and false-greens like INFO, but the STREAMED archive's
 *  first `meta.inf` entry marshals `fs.cfg` — the file store's own, rolled-back config. Reproduced live
 *  against an EACCES split: INFO and the initiation response both reported the requested TTL while the
 *  streamed `meta.inf` reported the old one. So a store-side detector EXISTS in the protocol, and this
 *  codebase has `downloadStreamSnapshot` plus a per-stream-scoped snapshot grant MODEL (`backup.ts`).
 *
 *  **It is NOT available under current authority, and that — not the cost — is what blocks it.**
 *  `assertBackupStream` runs every scope through `canonicalBackupStreamConfig`, which accepts only the
 *  durable registries (channel / acl / members) among KV buckets and THROWS for presence, delivery and
 *  manager. So wiring this in needs a NEW EXACT SCOPE, or a widening of the reconcile credential to
 *  whole-body snapshot authority over liveness data — an unsettled authority question on the credential
 *  this change otherwise keeps to three `STREAM.UPDATE` subjects. The cost is real too (it scales with
 *  bucket size, and a snapshot carries the bucket's records), but quoting only the cost would read as
 *  "available but expensive", which is the wrong summary. See the tracking issue for the full spec.
 *
 *  Stated here rather than left implied: this guard is a drift detector, not proof of enforcement — and
 *  "cannot be detected here" is the stronger claim it does NOT license.
 *
 *  CONSEQUENCE OF READING FIRST, which follows from the same split and is worth naming because the
 *  skip is deliberate: once `STREAM.INFO` reports the intended `max_age`, later reconciles see no
 *  drift and issue no update, so a bucket left unenforced by a metadata-write fault is not retried
 *  for as long as that server process lives.
 *
 *  WHERE THAT GOES depends on WHEN the write failed, and an earlier version of this comment got it
 *  wrong by generalising from one case. `writeStreamMeta` performs TWO writes — `meta.inf`, then
 *  `meta.sum` — and `UpdateConfig` rolls `fs.cfg` back if either fails:
 *    - **Failure BEFORE the first write commits** (the original EACCES reproduction): persisted state
 *      is coherent and old, so a restart makes `INFO` report the old value again and the next
 *      reconcile repairs it. Here the skip DEFERS a repair.
 *    - **Failure BETWEEN the two** (reproduced live by pointing `meta.sum.tmp` at `/dev/full`):
 *      `meta.inf` commits NEW while `meta.sum` stays OLD — a torn pair. On restart the server logs
 *      `checksums do not match` and recovery `continue`s past the stream, so it is SKIPPED: `INFO`
 *      returns **stream not found**, and the reconcile cannot repair it because its own first `INFO`
 *      gets not-found. **That case does not defer a repair, it loses the stream until an operator
 *      intervenes.**
 *  So "the persisted metadata is ground truth, restart repairs it" is TRUE ONLY of the
 *  before-first-atomic case, and "defers, never loses" is false in general. The read-first skip is
 *  still right — it keeps a healthy repeat `cotal up` to reads and no writes — but its worst case is
 *  worse than a deferred repair. Both branches reproduced live against 2.12.1 during review; see the
 *  tracking issue. */
