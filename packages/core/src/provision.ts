/**
 * The provisioner — the signer capability for a space.
 *
 * A space is one NATS *account*; every agent is a *user* in it. This module mints the
 * decentralized-JWT trust chain (operator → account → user) programmatically with
 * `@nats-io/jwt`, so there is no dependency on the external `nsc` CLI and the signing
 * key stays in one place (whoever holds {@link SpaceAuth.account.signingSeed}).
 *
 * Demo-1 stage: out-of-band mint. `cotal up` creates the space's trust material
 * once and writes a `nats-server` config (operator + system account + MEMORY resolver);
 * `cotal mint` and the manager load that material and mint per-agent creds files. There
 * is no connect-time token exchange yet (that's the later auth-callout stage).
 *
 * D5 adds the first credential-death primitive: profile-classified user-JWT lifetimes. Full revocation,
 * live eviction, standing-host renewal, and issuance audit still land in later D5 slices.

 *  spawn (`manager.ts withProvisioner`). It is ALSO the cred that creates the space's streams + KV buckets
 *  and seeds the channel registry via `setupSpaceStreams` (exercised by the manager-split smoke) — and
 *  `cotal up`'s ephemeral setup cred (`up.ts authSetup`) now mints THIS profile, not the broad `manager`.
 *  NEVER minted for an agent — `cotal mint` whitelists
 *  agent/observer/admin only, like `manager`/`delivery`.
 *
 *  This profile HOLDS the DM/DLV `CONSUMER.CREATE` push-consumer surface — the irreducible onboarding
 *  power (the create-time `deliver_subject` of a push consumer is not ACL-constrained, so whoever can
 *  create a DM/DLV consumer can stream the bodies). That is exactly why it is split OFF the always-on
 *  supervisor and made EPHEMERAL: the daemon opens a provisioner connection per spawn and drains it
 *  immediately, so the surface exists only for the provisioning window, not as a standing target. The
 *  cred is MEMORY-ONLY (never written to `.cotal`) and now carries a short profile-default `exp`; signer
 *  rotation, live eviction, and full revocation are later D5 slices.
 *
 *  `$JS` is an ENUMERATED allow-list, never `$JS.>`: STREAM.CREATE + INFO for the space streams/buckets,
 *  DM/DLV/TASK consumer CREATE/DURABLE.CREATE/INFO — and deliberately NO `MSG.NEXT`/`MSG.GET`/`ACK` on
 *  DM/DLV (it creates the bind-only mailbox but never reads it), and NO STREAM.DELETE/PURGE/MSG.DELETE
 *  (it provisions, it does not tear down). STREAM.UPDATE is held on EXACTLY four streams and no others:
 *  the three TTL'd KV buckets (presence + the two leases, #286 — an existing bucket's `max_age` cannot be
 *  fixed by `kvm.create`, so reconciling a pre-TTL deployment requires updating it) and the records store.
 *  Stated positively on purpose: this docblock previously read "NO …/UPDATE", which was already untrue of
 *  the records stream and became untrue of the buckets, and a comment that denies a credential's real
 *  power is worse than none — it is the document a reader trusts instead of checking. KV value-writes are

/** Render the `nats-server` config that trusts ONE broker operator and serves N spaces' accounts via
 *  the in-config MEMORY resolver.
 *
 *  Broker trust (operator + system account) comes from `broker` and has exactly one owner; the
 *  per-space data accounts are listed in `spaces`. Every space account is asserted to be signed by
 *  THIS broker's operator before it is preloaded: rendering a foreign-signed account would either
 *  refuse broker boot or, worse, advertise a tenant the broker cannot actually authenticate.
 *
 *  NOTE (W4): the MEMORY resolver is one static whole-broker map, so every mutation rewrites all of
 *  it. Concurrent add/remove of spaces needs a broker-authoritative inventory with generation/CAS
 *  and atomic promotion above this function; this renderer is deliberately pure. */
/**
 * Render the config for an OPEN (no-auth) broker.
 *
 * This exists so that no path reaches a listener without naming its transport. Open mode used to
 * start nats-server from bare CLI flags (`-js -sd … -p … -a …`) and never called `serverConfig` at
 * all, which meant the required `transport` union protected the auth path and was silent on the
 * open one: an operator could pass a cert and key, watch `up` print its normal banner, and get a
 * cleartext listener. That is the silent downgrade this feature exists to prevent, reachable by
 * someone who did everything right — so open mode renders a config too.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT reuse `serverConfig`: that renders the operator, system account and
 * MEMORY resolver, none of which a no-auth broker should carry. What the two share is the thing
 * that matters — a REQUIRED transport, so the choice cannot be omitted on either path.
 *
 * IMPORTANT, and it must be said wherever open-mode TLS is surfaced to an operator: TLS ON AN
 * OPEN MESH GIVES CONFIDENTIALITY, NOT AUTHENTICATION. It hides traffic from a passive observer.
 * It does not verify who is connecting, because an open broker has no credentials to check — so
 * anyone who can reach the port still gets in, encrypted. It is a legitimate configuration for a
 * mesh crossing a network nobody controls, and it is NOT "secure" in the sense a reader will
 * assume from seeing `cotals://`. Describe it as the caveat it is rather than as a feature.
