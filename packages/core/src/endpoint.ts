   * Multicast with an OPTIMISTIC-CONCURRENCY expectation and a caller-chosen dedup id, returning
   * the `PubAck` fields instead of discarding them. The serialized-append primitive: two writers
   * racing one subject cannot interleave, because the loser's expectation no longer holds.
   *
   * **Why a separate method rather than options on {@link multicast}.** `multicast` mints a fresh
   * `id` per call and drops the ack; both are right for ordinary chat and both are fatal to a
   * caller that must retry an append idempotently. Keeping them apart means no existing caller
   * changes behaviour, and the stricter validation below applies only where a caller opted in.
   *
   * - `id` becomes the JetStream `Nats-Msg-Id`, so the SAME id may be republished on retry and the
   *   server dedups it within the stream's duplicate window. It is validated rather than trusted:
   *   it lands in a wire header, and the dedup cache is **stream-wide**, so a caller-supplied id is
   *   both an injection surface and a way to suppress another publisher's message.
   * - `expectedLastSubjectSeq` is the sequence this publisher believes is the subject's tip; `0`
   *   means "the subject must be empty". A mismatch throws, and the throw stays classifiable by the
   *   already-public {@link isCasLoss} — the error is deliberately **not wrapped**, since wrapping
   *   would hide the `err_code` that classification reads.
   *
   * @throws if the endpoint is not live, the channel is not concrete, `id` is malformed, `parts` is
   *   empty, or `expectedLastSubjectSeq` is not a non-negative safe integer.

   *  is WRAPPED rather than bare precisely because of `complete`: a bare array cannot say whether
   *  older history remains behind it.
   *
   *  **Why this exists when `channelHistory` already works:** authorization. A consumer pins its
   *  authorization at CREATE time, so a caller whose read ACL is revoked mid-scroll keeps being served
   *  by the consumer it already holds. The mediator re-reads authorization on EVERY call (live

   *
   *  **The caller never names itself.** The daemon takes the principal from the broker-authenticated
   *  request subject ({@link serveControl} fail-closes when the payload `from` disagrees), so there is
   *  no caller-supplied identity to forge.
   *
   *  A channel outside the caller's read ACL THROWS. It must never come back as an empty page: "you
   *  may not read this" and "there is nothing here" are different answers and only one is safe to
   *  render as an empty conversation.
   *
   *  Chat channels only — DM history is deliberately not served here (it is god-view-only today, a

 *  `tcpInfoProbe` reports false for still passes this gate and goes on to a real connect.
 *
 *  It exists because `connect()` cannot be trusted to release a connection it never established.
 *  `@nats-io/transport-node`'s `NodeTransport.dial()` keeps its socket in a local until the
 *  handshake resolves (`this.socket = await this.dial(hp)`), so `this.socket` is STILL UNDEFINED
 *  when the client's own connect timeout wins the race in `protocol.ts`'s `dial` and the catch
 *  calls `transport.close()` — whose teardown is `this.socket?.destroy()`, i.e. a destroy of
 *  nothing. Against an address that BLACKHOLES (SYN unanswered) rather than REFUSES (RST), the
 *  socket is orphaned in libuv until the OS SYN timeout, and the process cannot exit for minutes
 *  after the probe already returned its answer. That is issue #389, and it is upstream: nothing a
 *  caller passes (`reconnect: false`, `timeout`) reaches the orphan. Our socket, our `destroy()`,
 *  on every exit path — never an `unref`/force-exit, which would hide the symptom and a future
