/**
 * v0.4 endpoint control-surface envelope (SPEC §13.3) — the versioned typed shapes riding the
 * §13.2 rails (`EndpointRequest`/`EndpointReply`/`EndpointEvent`), the structured error catalog,
 * W3C Trace Context correlation, and the consuming-boundary validators.
 *
 * Validation is FAIL-LOUD with the exact catalog code the spec assigns to each violation
 * (`unsupported-version`, `bad-request`, `contract-mismatch`, `op-mismatch`, `target-mismatch`,
 * `sender-mismatch`) so a rejecting boundary never invents a classification. Unknown object
 * fields are ignored (§5); the parsers return a picked copy carrying exactly the defined fields,
 * so nothing downstream can quietly grow a dependency on an undeclared one. Contract-schema
 * validation of `args`/`data` is §13.7's job ({@link import("./schema-profile.js")}); the helpers
 * here only map its outcome to the invocation-time code (`bad-request`, distinct from
 * registration-time `contract-invalid`).

 * sibling Worker land in the number too — measured at 16.4ms of process CPU against 0.18ms on the
 * measuring thread, already over this 10ms ceiling with almost no work done here. Node exposes no
 * per-thread CPU below 22.19 and the package floor is `>=22`, so there is no third instrument.
 *
 * A false refusal HERE answers the CALLER: a manager on a loaded or Worker-using host would tell
 * clients their valid arguments are malformed and silently degrade a live control plane. That is
 * strictly worse than the DoS this was guarding, which needs an attacker able to register a
 * contract. So enforcement stays where the attack actually lives — the REGISTRATION path, where
 * {@link import("./schema-profile.js").compileContract} still refuses `contract-invalid`, a false
 * positive fails a boot loudly rather than lying to a caller.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COMMENT USED TO CLAIM, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG. It said the deterministic profile bounds
 * "do the pre-emptive work", i.e. that registration-time bounds REPLACE request-path enforcement.
 * They do not, and that was disproved by execution rather than argued: a four-node schema —
 * trivially inside every byte, depth, ref-chain, node and closure bound — declaring
 * `uniqueItems: true` over an array of OBJECTS makes validation QUADRATIC IN THE CALLER'S DATA.
 * 3,000 valid objects measured 75ms and 5,000 measured 227ms, from ~54KB of entirely legitimate
 * input. No registration power, no oversized payload, no forgery. The profile bounds the SIZE and
 * SHAPE of a schema and the BACKTRACKING class via `maxPatternChars`; it has nothing for keywords
 * whose cost is non-linear in the VALUE being validated.
 *
 * BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THE DEMOTION DID AND DID NOT COST, because the obvious reading is wrong.
 * The gap is real and it PRE-DATES the demotion. The old code was
 *
 *     const okValid = validate(value);          // the whole cost is ALREADY PAID here
 *     const cpu = process.cpuUsage(startedCpu); // measured afterwards
 *     if (cpuMs > budget) fail("bad-request", …)
 *
 * so the refusal fired AFTER validation ran to completion. On a quadratic payload the enforcing
 * build burns exactly the same CPU as this one; it merely answers with an error instead of a
 * result. AGAINST RESOURCE EXHAUSTION, POST-HOC ENFORCEMENT BOUGHT NOTHING — an authorized caller
 * repeating the call cost the host the same before this change as after. What was removed was a
 * post-hoc classification, never a fence.
 *
 * AN INSTRUMENT ONLY GUARDS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER IT. That is the whole rule, and it is why the
 * reply-payload case is genuinely different: THAT throw preceded a downstream publish, so removing
 * it really did let an oversized reply through. Position, not intent, decides whether a check is a
 * fence or a verdict.
 *
 * So the honest statement is that this path has ALWAYS been unbounded for validation cost, and a
 * deterministic PRE-EMPTIVE defence is owed: a bound on argument bytes and items checked BEFORE
 * `validate` runs, refused as `resource-exhausted` (the caller's arguments are not malformed, they
 * are too expensive to admit — see `assertFactFits` in endpoint-journal.ts for the same shape), plus
 * a registration-time refusal of keywords whose cost is non-linear in the value. `max_payload` is
 * NOT that bound: at ~1 MiB it admits thousands of small objects, which is deep into the quadratic.
 *
 * The transferable lesson stands and is worth more than the incident: one unsound timer was standing
 * in for three jobs and was removed having enumerated one. REMOVING A GUARD REQUIRES ENUMERATING
 * WHAT IT WAS HOLDING UP — and then checking, for each, whether the guard actually PRECEDED the
 * thing it appeared to hold up. Two of the three here did not.
 *
 * The number stays, as an approximate observation, because it is still the only signal that a
 * registered contract is costing more than the profile intended. Treat it as a hint to go look at
 * the contract, never as a verdict about this request.
