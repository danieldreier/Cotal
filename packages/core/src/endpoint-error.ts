 *  refusal never arrives as a throw: it is the responder's own application-level failure and
 *  those ride the reply (§13.5). A consumer reads it off `reply.error`.
 *
 *  A REPLY THAT CONTRADICTS ITSELF IS NOT A REFUSAL. The marker IS the assertion that the command
 *  did not run, and {@link EpError.outcome} says a responder refusing before dispatch MUST carry
 *  `not-executed` — but {@link EpBindRefusedDetail} carries no outcome of its own, so nothing in the
 *  type stops a reply pairing the marker with `executed`. That combination is not merely odd: the
 *  only consumer of this predicate re-issues a command **without** the {@link isRepeatSafeCommand}
 *  gate, on the strength of the marker, so resolving the contradiction toward "refused" re-sends a
 *  command the reply just said had ALREADY RUN. A present outcome that disagrees therefore wins, and
 *  the reply is not read as a refusal.
 *
 *  AN ABSENT OUTCOME IS NOT A REFUSAL EITHER, and it is the same answer as `unknown` because the
 *  spec says they are the same value: SPEC 1510, "an error reply that omits `outcome` MUST be read
 *  as `unknown`". An earlier revision accepted absence, on the argument that a responder too old to
 *  know the field emits exactly that and refusing it would stop core repairing splits for a third
 *  party that is otherwise behaving. That argument does not survive SPEC 2271: a client MUST NOT
 *  automatically re-issue a command declared `write` after any outcome that does not prove
 *  non-execution, whatever `id` the re-issue carries, and `unknown` proves nothing. Since this
 *  predicate is what licenses a re-issue that SKIPS {@link isRepeatSafeCommand}, accepting absence
 *  made core re-issue writes on an outcome the spec says is `unknown`.
 *
 *  The cost is real and it is bounded: a responder that omits the field no longer has its splits
 *  repaired. That responder is already non-conforming, because §13.3 requires a refusal raised
 *  before dispatch to carry `not-executed`, so what it loses is a repair it was never owed. This
