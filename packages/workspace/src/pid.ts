/**
 * THE pid-attribution contract for machine-local pidfiles, in ONE place.
 *
 * Two copies of "parse a pid" + "is it alive" had drifted (a bounded parser in `auth-proc`, an
 * unbounded `Number.isInteger` parser plus a two-state `isAlive` in `down`), and the gap between a
 * guard's validity predicate and what `process.kill` actually accepts is exactly where a live
 * process gets misread as dead and its pidfile deleted under a clean-stop report. One parser, one
 * tri-state probe, so every surface that decides "is this record a live process, a dead one, or
 * unattributable" decides it the same way.
 *
 * WHO CAN ACTUALLY CONSUME IT, because "consumed everywhere" was never reachable and claiming it
 * hid the gap. This lives in `workspace` (machine-local operator tooling), the widest tier that may
 * hold a local-process concept: the CLI, the manager, the auth service and the web surface all
 * depend on it. `extensions/*` peer-depend `core` ONLY, and a pid probe is not a wire concept, so
 * moving it into core to reach them would leak a local concern into the standard. The two
 * extension-side probes (`connector-opencode`, `connector-hermes`) therefore keep their own copies
 * BY CONSTRUCTION, not by oversight; if they need this contract, the fix is a shared local-process
 * module they may depend on, never a core export.
