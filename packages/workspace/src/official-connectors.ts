 * The first-party agent connectors, name → npm package. This is NOT authority — a connector is
 * usable only once installed (seeded on first run, or `cotal ext add`ed) and imported, exactly like
 * a third-party one. It is the operator-UX source of truth so an absent official connector names its
 * REAL package in the install hint, and the seeder knows which built-ins to seed. A third-party
 * connector installs under its own package name and resolves the same way without appearing here.
 *
 * It lives in workspace (not cli) because both the CLI and the manager consume it and the manager
 * must not import the CLI — it is pure data supplied to the generic materialize/hint path.
