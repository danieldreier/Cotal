/**
 * The class-3 ($SYS) renewal owner's half, the counterpart to `renewal.ts`, which owns the class-2
 * standing renewal and deliberately EXCLUDES these two files.
 *
 * `membership-observer.creds` and `connection-evictor.creds` are `rotation-renewed`: they are signed
 * by the system-account seed, which is never persisted (`putSpaceAuth` strips it), so no running
 * process can re-sign them for their existing identity the way `remintDaemonCreds` does. Their only
 * renewal is a system-account ROTATION: a fresh $SYS account under the SAME broker operator, fresh
 * creds minted from its in-memory seed, and a broker that reloads the new operator/system JWTs.
 *
 * That rotation is NOT destructive. `rotateSystemAccount` re-signs the operator JWT with a new
 * `system_account` using the operator's own (unchanged) seed, so the space's DATA account, its
 * signing key, every agent credential minted from it, and the JetStream store all survive untouched.
 * What dies is exactly what should: the retired system account and any copy of the old $SYS creds.
 *
 * The one thing this module cannot do is make the broker load the result. Rotation is only complete
 * once the broker restarts on a `server.conf` rendered from the rotated record, which is why the
 * operator surface is `cotal up --rotate-sys` (the one command that already renders that config and
 * boots the broker + daemons from it) rather than a standalone verb that would leave the mesh in a
 * half-rotated state.
 *
 * WORKSTATION ONLY, deliberately: unlike `renewal.ts`, nothing here takes a {@link SecretStore}. The
 * $SYS pair lives on the raw FS with no store seam, and the multi-tenant guard below reads the FS
 * account records, which an injected store could neither supply nor be enumerated for. See
 * {@link rotateSystemCreds}.
 */

/** The two $SYS credential KINDS, in rotation-write order. They stay on the raw FS, with no injected
 *  secret-store seam: renewing them means rewriting the broker config too, so the pair and the trust
 *  record move together or not at all, which is not something a store can hold half of. Named here so
 *  the rotation writer, the staleness check and `cotal clean`'s removal list cannot drift apart —
 *  which is also why they are the KIND constants and not a second pair of literals (P7 made the
 *  kind and the location two different strings; a literal here would silently stay the old one). */

 * guard `remintDaemonCreds` runs: rotating with a foreign space's operator would re-issue an operator
 * JWT this broker does not trust and strand every account under it.
 *
 * Ordering is the safety property, and it is a DIRECTIONAL one, not atomicity. All MINTING (the
 * rotation and both creds) happens in memory before anything is persisted, so a mint failure changes
 * nothing on disk. Then the trust record commits, where `putSpaceAuth`'s generation guard refuses a
 * stale or non-successor write. Then the creds land. What this buys is a single failure direction: a
 * cred file is never overwritten for a system account the record does not already carry, because the
 * inverse order could clobber the last-good creds with creds for an authority the broker will never
 * load, which is the availability loss `remintDaemonCreds` guards on its own class.
 *
 * It does NOT make the persistence atomic. `putSpaceAuth` is two puts and the creds are two more, so
 * a crash leaves the record AHEAD of the creds. That state is detected rather than prevented (see
 * {@link staleSystemCreds}) and is repaired by re-running the rotation.
 *
 * THROWS rather than degrading: a stripped signer (no operator seed) cannot rotate, and a caller that
 * ignored the throw would boot a broker whose config still carries the retired system account.
