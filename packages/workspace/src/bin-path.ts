 *   - the PtyRuntime, which launches the EXACT path returned (resolve once; never validate one file
 *     and then launch a different one).
 *
 * `env` is explicit so a caller resolves against the SAME environment it will act on. Preflights pass
 * the operator env (default `process.env`); the PtyRuntime passes `spec.env` — its post-P3-isolation
 * launch env — so executable selection can't escape isolation: a poisoned manager PATH can't make the
 * child launch a different shim than the preflight saw.
 *
 * POSIX: the name IS the file — a bare name is looked up across PATH, an explicit path checked as
 * given, each via `accessSync(X_OK)`. Windows: there is no execute bit, so `accessSync(X_OK)` is
 * existence-only; a bare name (or a path lacking a known executable extension) is tried against each
 * `PATHEXT` extension IN ORDER — executables before scripts — so a real `claude.exe` beats a
 * `claude.cmd` shim in the same directory; a name that already carries a `PATHEXT` extension is taken
 * as-is.
