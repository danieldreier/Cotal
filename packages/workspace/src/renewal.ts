/** Re-sign the daemon creds files for their EXISTING nkeys (a renewal must never swap a daemon's
 *  identity — the daemon side pins it). Reads and writes through the secret-store seam; `store` is
 *  the renewal owner's injection point, SYMMETRIC with the daemon's `runDelivery(args, store?)`.
 *  The manager — the D5 standing-renewal owner, and a hosted-path caller (manager.ts calls this
 *  unconditionally) — passes the SAME store it gives the daemon (its `ManagerOptions.secretStore`),
 *  so a hosted composition re-signs into the store the daemon renews from, never a divergent one; no
 *  store means the local workspace FS composition (keys = the paths under `.cotal/`).
 *
 *  The creds are PER-SPACE as of P7, so every store op is addressed by the entry's
 *  `key(expectedSpace)` builder (§3.1) while every RESULT still reports the entry's `kind`.
 *
 *  `expectedSpace` (the caller's known space — the manager's `this.space`, doctor's resolved space) is
 *  a REQUIRED positional and is validated against the store's signer: the daemon creds are SPACE-SCOPED,
 *  so a store whose signer is for a DIFFERENT space (a swap after start, a misconfigured hosted mount)
 *  must NOT re-sign — that would overwrite each last-good cred with one the space's broker rejects,
 *  breaking the daemon on a value that looks freshly renewed. It is required (not optional) so the
 *  unsafe no-space call cannot compile — the same claim-exceeds-enforcement trap the cross-space fix
 *  would otherwise leave for the next caller. A signer that fails validation fails EVERY file
 *  (`ok:false`), leaving the standing creds intact toward their loud expiry rather than clobbering them.
 *  The store's ATOMIC put is load-bearing here, because the daemons re-read these values LIVE (the
 *  delivery endpoint's 75% source refresh, the membership feed's 75% renewal fetch).
 *
 *  The last-good cred is NEVER overwritten with an UNPROVEN one — a bundle's JWT chain is self-bound,
 *  not broker-bound (two `createSpaceAuth(space)` calls yield same-named, DIFFERENT-account chains), so
 *  a same-label alternate signer could mint a broker-dead cred and CLOBBER the last-good (availability
 *  loss). Proof before overwrite is one of: (1) `opts.preflight` — a disposable "does the broker accept
 *  this cred" probe the caller owns (the manager passes a {@link probeConnect} over `this.servers`),
 *  which gates EVERY candidate when supplied; or (2) AUTHORITY CONTINUITY — the candidate is signed by
 *  the SAME account signing key (`iss`) as the current (last-good, already broker-accepted) cred, the
 *  same authority the broker trusts, which the OFFLINE local repair (`doctor auth --fix`) relies on. A
 *  same-label alternate account breaks continuity, so with no preflight it is refused, not clobbered.
 *
 *  Structured per-file results, never throws: a failed remint leaves the old cred running toward its
 *  loud expiry and the caller records/reports the failure. */
