/**
 * Every `smoke:*` script must be RUN by something, or be listed here with a reason.
 *
 * This exists because the same defect kept arriving by different routes: a suite that proves
 * something real, is never executed by any automated path, and therefore proves nothing until
 * somebody runs it by hand. `smoke:manager-coexist` was the case that finally got it named — it
 * existed, passed 4/0, and had never been in `smoke:ci`. It was found by accident.
 *
 * A one-off diff someone remembers to run has exactly the failure mode it is checking for, so the
 * inventory is a gated suite: anything ungated and not on {@link UNGATED} fails here, immediately,
 * in the same run that added it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, so nobody mistakes it for full coverage: a suite can be gated and still
 * prove nothing. `smoke:sibling-mint-fence` and `smoke:secret-store-seam` sat inside `smoke:ci`
 * while dying in their own setup on a stale `serverConfig` signature — present, named after the
 * thing they claimed to prove, and vacuous. This checks that a suite is REACHED, never that it
 * asserts anything once reached. The two halves need different instruments.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:gate-inventory

 * Suites deliberately not run by any automated path, each with the reason it is excluded.

 * BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT THIS LIST IS. The entries below were the state of the repo when this check
 * was introduced; they are GRANDFATHERED DEBT, not forty-two individually justified decisions. The
 * reasons are grouped by inspection and several deserve a closer look than they have had. Recording
 * them as inventory is the point: the set stops growing silently, and shrinking it is ordinary work
 * against a written list rather than an archaeology exercise.
 *
 * ADDING A LINE HERE IS A DECISION, NOT A FIX. If a suite proves shipped behaviour, gate it.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF EXCLUSION LIVE HERE AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME KIND OF THING.
 *
 *   A STANDING DECISION - "no CI runner has this tooling", "this needs a real broker and an
 *   install tree". Nothing is expected to change. The entry is permanent and correct.
 *
 *   DEBT WITH A FUSE - "this suite is red" or "this suite is flaky". Something IS wrong, someone
 *   is expected to fix it, and the entry is supposed to disappear.
 *
 * Until now both were written the same way: a key and a sentence. So a red suite parked here was
 * indistinguishable from one that legitimately does not belong in CI, and the list could not tell
 * you how much debt it was carrying. That is how `smoke:auth` sat here for six weeks with its
 * cause correctly diagnosed in its own reason string - the note was accurate, and nothing counted
 * it or expected it to end.
 *
 * So the second kind carries a {@link BROKEN} prefix and is counted separately, the way UNTRIAGED
 * already is. The count is not a failure and is not enforced: it is a number that is supposed to
 * go down, printed where the person adding the next entry will see it.
