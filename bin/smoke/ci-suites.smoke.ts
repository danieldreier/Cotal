/**
 * The `smoke:ci` chain file's PARSER, which is the thing this migration actually introduced.
 *
 * The chain used to be a single `&&` string in package.json. A string has no syntax: there was
 * nothing to mis-parse. A text file has syntax - comments, blank lines, whitespace - and every one
 * of those is a new way for an entry to mean something other than what it looks like.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE CHAIN'S OWN CHECKS. `smoke:gate-inventory` grades the chain's
 * CONTENT: that every entry resolves to a defined script, that nothing is duplicated, that it is
 * not empty. Those checks pass against a parser that mishandles all three shapes below, because
 * the real chain file currently contains no comment, no blank line and no trailing space - so the
 * first person to add one is the person who finds out. Proving the migration preserved the chain
 * proves nothing about the parser, since the proof ran on a well-formed file.
 *
 * THE EMPTY CASE IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. The chain-level guard says "a chain of fewer than two
 * suites fails". That is only true if an empty chain cannot be produced SILENTLY - so a missing or
 * unreadable file must throw at the reader rather than return `[]` and let the guard decide. Which
 * of the two fires is asserted here rather than left as a property nobody wrote down.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:ci-suites
