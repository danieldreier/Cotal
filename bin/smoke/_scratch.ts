/**
 * A temp root that `findCotalRoot` cannot capture — the one sandbox a smoke cannot get from
 * `COTAL_HOME`.
 *
 * `findCotalRoot` (`packages/workspace/src/auth-paths.ts`) walks to `/` with no boundary, exactly
 * like git finding `.git`. So ANY `.cotal` in an ancestor of `os.tmpdir()` makes every scratch dir
 * a suite mints resolve as that ancestor's project root, and `cotalPath()` writes the mesh's
 * `.cotal/manager.pid`, `manager.log`, `nats/`, and auth material THERE instead of into the
 * fixture. Sandboxing `COTAL_HOME` does not help: that is the machine home, a different root.
 *
 * The damage is not a wrong path, it is a silent disarm. A cell written as
 * `if (existsSync(pidFile)) kill(...)` skips its own body, the fixture never arms, and the suite
 * grades a healthy product against a state it failed to create. That is how a captured root
 * surfaces: not as "file not found", but as a confident, wrong failure somewhere else.
 *
 * WHY THIS PASSES LOCALLY AND REDS IN CI. The exposure is not the same on both. On Linux (and so on
 * CI) `os.tmpdir()` IS `/tmp`, so a `/tmp/.cotal` left behind by any ordinary `cotal` run captures
 * EVERY suite that mints a fixture there. On macOS the default temp root is `/var/folders/<…>/T`,
 * whose ancestry is clean, so a `/private/tmp/.cotal` on the same machine captures only suites that
 * hardcode `/tmp` (or run under a TMPDIR someone pointed there). A suite can therefore be green on
 * a developer's Mac and red on CI with the product working perfectly in both.
 *
 * Call `makeScratch()` FIRST, before importing anything that resolves a root, and tear the returned
 * directory down in `finally`. Pair it with `assertScratchHeld()` after the fixture exists: the
 * sandbox is what makes the suite pass, but the assertion is what keeps it honest if the sandbox
 * ever stops working.

 *
 * Bases are tried in order: the CI runner temp (never `/tmp` on GitHub Actions), the current temp,
 * then `/var/tmp`. A captured base is SKIPPED, not used with a warning — using it is the defect.
 * If every candidate is captured this THROWS, naming each base and why: a suite that cannot be
 * hermetic must fail loudly at its first line, not run and grade.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT — base DEPTH, not ancestry. Because this repoints `TMPDIR`, anything that later opens
 * a unix domain socket under it inherits the chosen path, and `sun_path` caps a socket path at 104
 * bytes on macOS (108 on Linux). A deeply nested base therefore kills the child launcher rather
 * than the suite: `tsx` dies `listen EINVAL … <base>/tsx-<uid>/<pid>.pipe` before the suite body
 * runs at all. Measured: 129 bytes under a nested per-tool temp fails; the ordinary
 * `/var/folders/<…>/T/cotal-*` (~87) and `/var/tmp/cotal-*` are fine, as is CI's `RUNNER_TEMP`.
 * Selection is deliberately NOT sorted by length — `RUNNER_TEMP` is preferred because CI cleans it
 * between jobs, and trading that for a shorter path would trade a real guarantee for a rare one.
 * If you see `listen EINVAL` from a suite that uses this helper, it is path LENGTH, not capture.
