/**
 * The goal-follow subscription contract (#610): a caller that is REFUSED its per-goal progress
 * subscription must be told so, distinctly, and must never be handed a timeout.
 *
 * WHY A HAND-BUILT CELL, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO A READER. This drives
 * {@link submitAndFollowGoal} against a stub connection whose subscribe answers with an error,
 * because the failure it grades cannot be minted through the public API any more: since the
 * companion fix in `provision.ts`, a spawn-capable credential CARRIES the progress row, so the
 * denial this cell needs is no longer reachable from a real credential. That is the right outcome
 * for the product and it leaves this branch testable only by construction. It therefore proves the
 * BRANCH, not that a real door reaches it; `smoke:user-spawn:live` carries the end-to-end half
 * (a spawn-scope caller following its own goal to terminal over a real authed mesh).
 *
 * The distinction matters because the two failures want opposite responses from an operator: a
 * timeout invites a retry, and a retry submits a second goal and duplicates the effect (#605
 * records one duplicate created exactly that way). A denial wants a grant.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:goal-follow
