/**
 * `cotal up --tls-cert/--tls-key` ENCRYPTS OR REFUSES TO START, on every route to a listener.
 *
 * This suite exists because the previous one did not test the feature. It proved that a
 * TLS-required listener refuses cleartext, that the served leaf matches the file on disk, and that
 * `INFO` advertises `tls_required` — all true, all about the gate, and every one of them still green
 * while `cotal up -f`, `cotal up --detach` and a refresh accepted `--tls-cert` and served PLAINTEXT
 * while printing `✓ mesh up`. A broker that refused every client would have passed it in full.
 *
 * So the shape here is deliberate:
 *
 *  - EVERY ROUTE IS DRIVEN THROUGH THE REAL CLI, as a subprocess, with the operator's own flags.
 *    Nothing is constructed in this file. The three downgrades were all at call boundaries between
 *    `up`'s argument parsing and the code that starts a listener, which is precisely the region a
 *    test that builds its own inputs cannot see.
 *
 *  - EVERY REFUSAL IS PAIRED WITH AN ADMISSION, over the same broker, on the same port, sending the
 *    same CONNECT line, differing in exactly one variable: whether the socket is upgraded to TLS.
 *    Without that pair, "cleartext was refused" is satisfied by a broker that refuses everything,
 *    including one that failed to start.
 *
 *  - THE ADMISSION LEG VERIFIES THE CERTIFICATE PROPERLY rather than routing around the problem.
 *    An earlier version dropped this leg because `isReachable(tls: true)` could not verify a
 *    self-signed certificate, and substituted a handshake-level probe. That was a correct fix to a
 *    real problem and it silently narrowed the claim from "the mesh works over TLS" to "TLS
 *    completes". Here the material is signed by a throwaway CA that is passed to `tls.connect` as
 *    `ca`, with `rejectUnauthorized: true`, so the chain and the hostname are both actually checked.
 *
 *  - REFUSALS ASSERT ON THE REASON, and every refusal cell first proves it reached the RIGHT broker.
 *    `assertCleartextRefused` requires an `INFO` line (a broker exists) advertising `tls_required`
 *    (it is the listener under test) BEFORE it will accept silence as evidence. Without those two,
 *    "no reply" is satisfied by a closed port, a wrong port, or a typo — and since the expected
 *    result is silence, nothing would be left over to look wrong.
 *
 *  - ROUTES A–E RUN `--open` so a refused CONNECT cannot be an auth failure, which is what lets them
 *    assert on the transport. ROUTE F RUNS AUTHED, because testing a fence with the fence disabled
 *    is a structural blind spot: an open-mesh green has hidden a permissions fact repeatedly
 *    elsewhere. It carries its own discriminator — the same credential admitted over TLS and refused
 *    in the clear — so the two questions stay separable rather than collapsing into one boolean.
 *
 * Sandbox: each cell gets its own `COTAL_HOME` **and** a temp project `cwd` with its own `.cotal/`.
 * `COTAL_HOME` alone only relocates the mesh registry; broker policy, the NATS store, and pidfiles
 * follow `findCotalRoot` from cwd. A probe that sets only `COTAL_HOME` and runs `cotal up` from a
 * tree whose walked root is the operator home can still write live operator config — do not copy
 * that pattern. Every broker started here is reaped in the `finally`.
 * Needs `nats-server` and `openssl` on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:up-tls:live  (BUILD FIRST — the CLI
 * subprocess runs built dist, so an unbuilt edit to `packages/core` is invisible to it.)
