/**
 * spawn.env END TO END - the composed operator path, not its pieces.
 *
 * WHAT NOTHING ELSE COVERED. Every layer of this feature had a test and the COMPOSITION had none.
 * `launchEnv` is unit-tested, the connectors are tested against hand-built opts, `env-isolate` spawns
 * real pty and tmux children from a spec it builds itself, and the config layering is tested through
 * `loadCotalConfig`. Nobody had ever watched a real config file on disk confine a real child process.
 * `spawn.env` is the headline of this change and its containment was inferred rather than observed.
 *
 * So this drives the whole chain and asks the operating system what happened: a config file written
 * to the real operator path, read by the real loader, resolved by the same `spawnEnvAllow` the CLI
 * and the manager call, handed to a real connector's `buildLaunch`, and used to start an actual
 * process that reports the environment it actually received.
 *
 * THE EXPECTATION COMES FROM THE CONFIG THIS SUITE WROTE, NEVER FROM `envAllow`. That is not a
 * stylistic choice. The first version branched on `envAllow` to decide what to assert, so breaking
 * the resolution made the confined arm quietly take the inherit branch and pass: it derived its
 * expectation from the value under test. There is no inherit branch anymore — the default path
 * withholds undeclared names — but the rule still holds: a cell may read the input the operator
 * supplied and the output the OS produced, and nothing in between.
 *
 * THIS GRADES `dist/`, NOT `src/`. `bin/` resolves the workspace packages to their builds, so a
 * source edit is invisible here until it is built. That is the right target for a composition test,
 * since the built artifact is what ships, but it means a mutation against `src` proves nothing about
 * this suite and must be made against the build.
 *
 * Proven to fail, twice, against the artifacts that actually execute:
 *   - `spawnEnvAllow` forced to `undefined`  -> 6 failures, every connector, resolution + containment
 *   - one connector dropping `envAllow`      -> 1 failure, naming that connector, others still green
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:spawn-env-e2e
