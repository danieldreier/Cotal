/**
 * LIVE e2e for the launch readiness window (#159 B1): a REAL broker, a REAL in-process manager
 * (real pty runtime), and a spawned agent that deliberately takes ~7s to JOIN the mesh — past
 * requestControl's 5s op default, inside the manager's ~30s readiness backstop. The manager only
 * replies on the real outcome (the join), so each launch client must outlive it; before the fix
 * both doors here died client-side ("TIMEOUT") while the launch proceeded:
 *
 *  A. `MeshAgent.spawn` (connector-core — the MCP `cotal_spawn` door) → `start` op → real success
 *     reply arrives AFTER the 5s default would have given up.
 *  B. `launchAgent` (cli — `cotal spawn -f` onto a running mesh) → admin `launch` op → same.
 *
 * Open mode (authed control is covered by smoke:control-auth); COTAL_HOME sandboxed; kills only
 * the PIDs it spawns. Needs nats-server on PATH.
 * Run: pnpm smoke:readiness:live   (build first — imports @cotal-ai/* dist)
