/**
 * Ambient-environment census over the SUITES themselves - the cell for a class this repo's runtime
 * cells structurally cannot see.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS HAPPENING. A suite builds a child process env as `{ ...process.env, ...somethingOurs }`.
 * Whatever runs that suite may itself be a managed agent session, whose environment carries a live
 * credential path, a live broker URL and a control token. The spread hands all of it to the child.
 * Two suites were doing exactly this and both were GREEN: the connector env layered on top used to
 * overwrite precisely the variables that would have made the inheritance visible, so the child got a
 * working identity and nothing anywhere recorded where it came from.
 *
 * WHY A RUNTIME CELL CANNOT CATCH IT. `seat-env-scope` watches what a connector's launch spec hands
 * a real descendant. It has no view of what ANOTHER suite's harness inherits from ITS runner. The
 * only shape that can fail a future suite which reintroduces the spread is a static census over the
 * suite sources, which is what this is. The idea is a reviewer's, not mine.
 *
 * THE RULE. Every suite file that spreads `...process.env` into a child environment must either
 * strip the `COTAL_` variables from the copy first, or appear in {@link EXEMPT} with a measured
 * reason. Exempt is not "we looked away": each entry names why that file's child cannot capture an
 * identity, and adding one is a conscious edit in a file a reviewer reads.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm smoke:suite-ambient-env`

/**
 * THE RATCHET, and read the next sentence before you read the list.
 *
 * IT IS A TRACKED DEFERRAL, NOT A WAIVER: the 44 are owned by issue #619, which carries the names,
 * which of them spawn the CLI, and what "done" looks like for each. A frozen baseline pointing at an
 * open issue is a deferral; one pointing at nothing is a waiver that outlives everyone who agreed to
 * it. If #619 is closed and this list is not empty, this comment is the lie and the list is the
 * truth.
 *
 * THESE FILES ARE NOT CLEARED. Nobody has measured whether their children read connection material,
 * and this suite does not claim they are safe. They are the ambient spreads that already existed
 * when this census was written, frozen so that the SET CANNOT GROW. A new suite that spreads without
 * stripping fails here; an old one keeps doing what it was already doing until somebody audits it.
 *
 * Saying that plainly matters more than the list. A frozen baseline presented as a clean bill of
 * health is worse than no baseline, because the next reader stops looking. Several of these spawn the
 * `cotal` CLI, which DOES read connection material, so some of them are very likely real instances of
 * the same defect that was found twice on this branch. Auditing them is its own piece of work and
 * does not belong in a credential change.
 *
 * The ratchet also TIGHTENS: an entry that no longer spreads must be deleted from this list, so the
 * baseline shrinks as files are fixed and can never quietly become a permanent waiver.
