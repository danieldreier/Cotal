/**
 * `cotal attach` redeems with the seed the MESH resolved, never one walked up from the cwd (#722) -
 * pnpm smoke:attach-auth-root
 *
 * A REAL nats-server in AUTH mode, a REAL manager, a REAL supervised seat, and the REAL `cotal`
 * binary as a subprocess standing in the directory under test. The cwd is not a parameter here, it
 * is the whole experiment: the walk this suite is about only happens in a process that actually
 * stands somewhere.
 *
 * The defect: resolution picks a root from the mesh registry and connects with it, then redemption
 * asked the CURRENT DIRECTORY the same question and used whatever it answered. On a real machine
 * the two disagree rather than in theory, because `findCotalRoot` accepts any directory merely
 * NAMED `.cotal` and `~/.cotal` is one on every install (the registry lives there). A command run
 * anywhere under $HOME outside a project therefore minted its credential from the home directory's
 * trust and presented it to a broker that trusts a different chain, surfacing as a bare
 * `Authorization Violation` that named nothing.
 *
 * What runs here:
 *   A. the detector's three states on a REAL mesh pair: a divergent anchor is named, the resolved
 *      root itself is silent, an unanchored directory is silent, and a SECOND CHECKOUT holding the
 *      SAME chain is silent (a detector that fired there would be noise an operator learns to skip).
 *   B. attach from a fossil-anchored directory: the broker does not refuse it, and the shadowing
 *      anchor is REPORTED rather than obeyed.
 *   C. attach from a directory with NO anchor: it attaches through the registry-resolved trust.
 *      This is the capability that regresses the moment redemption needs a local seed, and it is
 *      asserted POSITIVELY on the banner attach prints once the session is open, not on the absence
 *      of an error.
 *   D. the refusal, where there genuinely is no seed (a raw off-registry connection), names what
 *      the command resolved and points at no internal work item.
 *
 * TWO CHAINS, ONE SPACE NAME: `createSpaceAuth` is not broker-bound, so two calls for the same
 * space yield same-named accounts with different keys. That is the fossil-anchor situation exactly,
 * without needing a decommissioned mesh to have existed.
 *
 * ANCHOR HYGIENE IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT, NOT SETUP. The suite selects a writable OS temp parent
 * whose ancestry it first proves has no `.cotal`; on POSIX `/dev/shm` is the second candidate when
 * the ordinary temp tree is contaminated. It then asserts the selected base is still unanchored.
 * This keeps the refusal honest without making a persistent `/tmp/.cotal` poison every hosted rerun.
 *
 * COTAL_HOME and XDG_CONFIG_HOME are sandboxed; kills ONLY the PIDs it spawns. Needs nats-server on PATH.
