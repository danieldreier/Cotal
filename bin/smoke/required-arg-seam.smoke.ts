/**
 * REQUIRED-ARGUMENT SEAM (Cotal #550): every call site of a seam that THROWS when an argument is
 * missing must actually pass it, checked statically over sources the compiler does not read.
 *
 * "EVERY CALL SITE" MEANS EVERY ONE THIS READER CAN SEE, and what it can see is a decision recorded
 * in this file rather than a property of the repository. It reads the extensions in `EXTS`, plus the
 * executable part of each container language in `CONTAINERS`; it counts calls made through the
 * seam's own NAME, and turns every spelling that rebinds that name RED rather than following it, so
 * the bound fails loud instead of narrowing in silence. The population watches the seeing itself.
 * Read the paragraph headed THE ALIAS REFUSAL IS NOT A PROOF OF TOTAL CLOSURE as part of this
 * sentence rather than as a footnote to it.
 *
 * WHY A RUNTIME THROW IS NOT ENOUGH, in the words of the one seam that has this shape today:
 * `standaloneConnectOpts` refuses to build connect options without an explicit `tls` boolean, and
 * its own comment records the limit, that smoke files sit outside the tsconfigs so a large minority
 * of its call sites are never typechecked. The throw is the correct response to that. But a guard
 * whose only reader is a suite, is heard only when the suite runs, and the failure it produces does
 * not look like a missing argument: it stops the suite where it fires, so an author sees a run that
 * ends after N cells. A suite that gets SHORTER reads as a shorter suite, not a broken one. That is
 * how a real occurrence of this went unheard: `user-spawn` threw at its section B1e and lost roughly
 * fifty cells, and nothing said so.
 *
 * So the reader here is static and gated: a new call site missing the argument is red in the run
 * that adds it, whatever suite it belongs to and whether or not that suite is ever executed.
 *
 * IT READS THE REAL GRAMMAR, via the TypeScript parser, and that is a correctness requirement rather
 * than a convenience. The first two cuts of this file scanned text with a hand lexer and a call
 * regex, and both were defeated by ordinary code rather than by anything contrived. A regex literal
 * containing a quote opened a phantom string that blanked every later call site in the file, so the
 * lexer learned regexes; then the same hole reopened one keyword away, because `/` after `return` or
 * `typeof` looks like division to anything that decides by the last CHARACTER. The population cells
 * do not cover a file that was ALWAYS hidden: its sites were never counted, so the expected count
 * still passes. Chasing lexer holes one at a time is a losing shape when a parser that already knows
 * the grammar costs about seven hundred milliseconds over nine hundred files. Everything below asks
 * the syntax tree, so regex-versus-division, template substitutions, casts, generic instantiation,
 * optional calls and unicode escapes in identifiers are the parser's problem and not this file's.
 *
 * THE SEAM MUST BE CALLED BY ITS OWN NAME, and a rebinding is red rather than ignored. This reader
 * has no type checker, so it cannot follow `const f = seam` or `import { seam as f }` to the call
 * that uses `f`, and a call it cannot follow is a call it would silently bless. It therefore refuses
 * the rebinding itself, at the point the name escapes, which is one line for an author to see and
 * fail-closed for everyone else. The name counts as escaping whether it is spelled as an identifier
 * or as a string, because `const f = core["seam"]` reaches the same binding as `const f = seam` and
 * a rule about identifiers cannot see it. What stays legal is every form that binds the name this
 * reader already scans for: a same-name import, re-export or destructure, `import { default as
 * seam }`, and an object key, which names a slot rather than reading the seam (the READ of such a
 * table is caught, and a call through it is counted, so flagging the key would say something
 * untrue). Each of those has a cell, so the refusal cannot quietly become a false red on the live
 * idiom.
 *
 * SEAMS is a table because the class is "a runtime-required argument whose callers are only partly
 * typechecked", not one function. It has one row today because one seam in this repo has that
 * shape. Adding the next one is a line.
 *
 * TWO DIRECTIONS OF ERROR, and they are not equally bad. Blessing a site that lacks the argument is
 * severe: the check then reads as coverage and is not. Failing to SEE a site is caught by the count
 * cells, which is why a count is part of the instrument rather than trivia.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, so nobody mistakes it for more than it is: it checks that the argument
 * is PASSED, never that its value is right. `tls: false` against a TLS broker is a wrong value and
 * this check is blind to it, by design, because the seam it guards demands a decision rather than a
 * particular decision. The one value it does judge is an `undefined` written AT THE CALL, on any
 * branch, which is not a boolean and which the seam throws on, so stating the key that way counts as
 * omitting it. A value held in a VARIABLE is mostly not judged, and the one exception is a `const`
 * bound to `undefined`, which is that value written in two steps rather than a value this reader
 * cannot see. That exception now applies in BOTH spellings, `{ tls: t }` and shorthand `{ tls }`,
 * because shorthand reads a binding of the key's own name; review demonstrated the gap by rewriting
 * a real counted site into shorthand IN PLACE, leaving the counts and every cell green while the
 * call threw. Anything else in a variable is not judged and cannot be, since deciding what it holds
 * is symbol resolution. It also
 * cannot see through a WRAPPER: a function that takes an options object and passes it on is a call
 * site whose own argument is an identifier, which lands as `unverifiable` rather than as a pass.
 *
 * ONE KNOWN FALSE-RED CLASS is carried deliberately rather than fixed, and it is written here so it
 * is a decision rather than a surprise. Both sides of `||` and `??` are treated as real alternatives,
 * so `tls: (undefined as any) || false` is reported missing even though the expression can only ever
 * evaluate to `false`, and `tls: false ?? undefined` likewise. Pruning provably dead branches would
 * be sound and would only ever turn reds green, but it is arithmetic on operator semantics added to
 * a file that has already produced four false-red classes by adding cleverness late, so the residual
 * is stated instead. Neither spelling has an occupant here, and both are stiff enough that a person
 * writing `false` would write `false`.
 *
 * THE ALIAS REFUSAL IS NOT A PROOF OF TOTAL CLOSURE, and it should not be read as one. It refuses
 * every spelling that names the seam statically, as an identifier or as a string, in the positions
 * that can obtain it: a property read off a namespace or a table, a rename in a destructure whether
 * that destructure DECLARES or ASSIGNS, a quoted import or re-export rename, a shorthand capture,
 * and the name handed to a call as data. The key it reads may be assembled, because `"standalone" +
 * "ConnectOpts"` and a template whose spans all fold are arithmetic a reader does by eye; review
 * showed each of these is ordinary code rather than exotica, and documenting an escape is not
 * closing it.
 *
 * The declaration/assignment pair is worth naming because the two look identical in source and are
 * not identical to the parser: `const { seam: f } = core` is a BindingElement, while
 * `({ seam: f } = core)` is an ordinary object KEY, which this reader allows everywhere else
 * because a key normally names a slot rather than reading one. Only position tells them apart.
 *
 * THE PLAIN-SOURCE DOOR HAS A CENSUS, and keeping the census current is the point of writing it here.
 * A document
 * refuses a computed key it cannot settle; a plain source does not, so `export const KEY = "<seam>"`
 * in one file and `core[KEY]({ ... })` in another is SILENT. Review measured it. The fence was not
 * extended to plain sources because that was measured too: refusing every unsettled computed key
 * across the tree reddens ten call sites that have nothing to do with this seam (four on a clean
 * checkout, and the gap is a gitignored bundle, see A FOURTH boundary below), most of them in
 * vendored bundles, and a check that cries wolf on ordinary code teaches people to route around it.
 * What IS closed everywhere, because it can be closed for free, is the order-dependent name: a key
 * folding through a name declared more than once, where some declaration spells the seam, is refused
 * in a plain source exactly as in a document.
 *
 * THE DOOR'S OTHER SPELLINGS are all ways of writing a table that the fold map declines to ADMIT,
 * and they are listed because each was MEASURED silent at this tip rather than reasoned about. The
 * control is a plain `const T = { k: "<seam>" }; core[T.k]({...})`, which IS seen: it moves the
 * population to 95 and reddens. Each of the following leaves the population at 94 with the suite
 * fully green, which is what makes them misses rather than opinions:
 *
 *   - a NESTED table, `const T = { a: { k: "<seam>" } }; core[T.a.k]`, since the fold reads one
 *     level of properties rather than a path;
 *   - a key DESTRUCTURED out of a table, `const { k } = T; core[k]`, since a binding pattern is not
 *     a name this map collects;
 *   - a table destructured out of a literal, `const { T } = { T: { k: "<seam>" } }`, the same gap
 *     one level up;
 *   - a table wrapped in `Object.freeze`, since the admission test wants a bare object literal and
 *     freeze's initializer is a CALL. This is the one to flinch at, because freezing a constant
 *     table is ordinary defensive style rather than a way to hide anything;
 *   - a GETTER-valued property, `{ get k() { return "<seam>" } }`, where there is no initializer to
 *     fold at all.
 *
 * THOSE FIVE ARE A SAMPLE, NOT A CENSUS, and pretending otherwise was this file's own mistake for
 * several rounds. Adversarial review measured NINE more silent spellings at one sitting: `Object.seal`,
 * `Object.preventExtensions`, `Object.assign({}, ...)`, a class STATIC property, an enum member, an
 * `as const` array indexed by literal, `Object.freeze` applied AFTER construction, a spread copy of
 * another table, and a namespace const. Enumerating them would invite a fifteenth.
 *
 * So state the door by what the fold map ADMITS, which is closed and short, rather than by what it
 * excludes, which is unbounded. A table is folded only when ALL THREE hold: its initializer is a
 * bare object literal, its name is declared exactly once in the file, and every mention of that name
 * is a property access. Anything failing any clause is not folded, its key does not settle, and a
 * call through it is not seen. That is the whole door, and it is a description a reader can check.
 *
 * AND WRITING A NEW ONE IS FREE, which is the sharp end and was understated here until review
 * measured it. A call in a non-admitted spelling was never counted, so ADDING one moves the
 * population not at all: no conversion, no compensating call, nothing. The counts police only the
 * SEEN population. The convert-and-compensate composite described above is what it takes to hide an
 * EXISTING counted call; hiding a NEW one takes a single ordinary-looking edit.
 *
 * None of this is closed, and that is a judgement rather than an oversight. Every closure in this
 * area has opened a sibling, five times running, and four of those cost a FALSE RED that had to be
 * found before it could be fixed. It is all MISS-side, the direction where being wrong spends
 * coverage instead of credibility. No cell asserts any individual miss, deliberately: a cell that
 * pins a hole reads as intent to the next author, which is precisely how the previous hole survived
 * two reviews. The census cell instead executes the SAMPLE plus a control, so the sample cannot rot
 * unnoticed, while making no claim to completeness that it could not keep.
 *
 * THREE OF ITS BOUNDARIES ARE CURATION, not deduction, and adversarial review measured each one
 * silent. The container WATCHLIST decides which markup languages get a recorded decision, so an
 * arrival it does not list (a `.php` naming the seam was the probe) is read by nothing and reddens
 * nothing. SKIP_DIRS is the same bet on directories: adding `examples` to it drops six container
 * files from the walk with every cell still green, because the census that guards the walk shares
 * the same skip list and simply sees a smaller tree. And the COUNTS measure population, not
 * identity, so moving sites between files is indistinguishable from losing them; the split into a
 * total and an untypechecked half catches a move ACROSS the halves, and nothing catches a move
 * within one.
 *
 * That last boundary COMPOSES with the door spellings below, and the composition is worth stating
 * because neither half is alarming alone. A door spelling is a way to write a call this reader does
 * not see; population-not-identity means an unseen call and a deleted one are the same number. So
 * rewriting one counted site into a door spelling AND adding any ordinary counted call elsewhere in
 * the same half leaves the count at exactly 94/67 with every cell green, while a call that throws at
 * runtime sits in the tree. That pair is only needed to hide an ALREADY COUNTED call; a call written
 * in a non-admitted spelling from the start is never counted, so adding one costs nothing at all. That was reproduced here rather than reasoned about: one site converted
 * to a nested table with `tls` dropped, one plain compensating call added, suite green at 143 of 143.
 * The counts are therefore NOT cover for the door. They pin that the SEEN population stays seen, and
 * even that only against an author who does not add a call while removing one. Closing it needs
 * identity rather than population, which is the site manifest named below and a different instrument.
 *
 * THE DELIBERATE AUTHOR IS OUT OF SCOPE, by this file's construction rather than by omission, and
 * saying so is what keeps the paragraph above from reading as a security claim it cannot make. Every
 * instrument here is aimed at ACCIDENT and negligence. Someone who WANTS to conceal a call can edit
 * this file, lower the counts, or delete the census, so a manifest would only move concealment from
 * a dummy call to a dummy manifest line. What such an instrument actually buys is accidental-drift
 * visibility, and the accidental form is the narrow real one: two unrelated edits landing in a single
 * change, one refactoring a site into a table and one adding a call elsewhere in the same half. That
 * is the case a follow-up earns, and the shape it should take is PER-FILE exact counts rather than
 * file and line, since line numbers would redden on every unrelated edit to a touched file and
 * reintroduce exactly the cry-wolf tax this design exists to avoid.
 *
 * A FOURTH boundary is the TREE ITSELF, and it matters more now that the counts are matched exactly
 * rather than as floors. This walk reads the FILESYSTEM, not the commit, so a working copy that has
 * run a build carries files a fresh clone does not. `node_modules`, `dist`, `build` and friends are
 * skipped, but a generated bundle landing outside those names is not: the Hermes sidecar at
 * `extensions/connector-hermes/plugin/cotal/_sidecar/` is gitignored build output and IS walked.
 * Today it costs nothing, measured both ways: 94/67 with the bundle present and 94/67 with it moved
 * aside. It is on the record because an EXACT count turns any future divergence into a red that
 * depends on whether someone ran `pnpm bundle`, which is a property of a disk rather than of a
 * revision. Reading it is deliberate rather than an oversight, since that bundle SHIPS in the
 * connector package: a seam call inside it would be real, and skipping it would be a hole in shipped
 * code rather than a tidier number. Review found this by measuring the same fence on two trees and
 * getting ten refusals against four, which is the same lesson one level up.
 *
 * Each would need a different instrument (a site manifest, a census that does not share
 * the walk's exclusions), and each is written here so the next author inherits the bet rather than
 * the impression that it was checked.
 *
 * What it still cannot EVALUATE is a key computed from a runtime value, a function's return
 * (`["standalone", "ConnectOpts"].join("")` reaches the same binding), or an import it would have to
 * resolve. Closing those means executing the program or running a type checker, which is a different
 * instrument rather than a better rule. In a PLAIN source that stays a residual with the count as
 * its only cover.
 *
 * That residual USED to be wider than the sentence above admitted, and adversarial review is what
 * measured the difference. A stringly dispatch table written in ONE file, `const API = { connect:
 * "<seam>" }; core[API.connect]({creds})`, needs no runtime value and no import: it is static to any
 * human reading it, and it was invisible. A table's string properties now fold, so that call is seen
 * and classified like any other. What remains open is genuinely CROSS-FILE: `export const KEY =
 * "<seam>"` in one file and `core[KEY]({...})` in another. Fencing that was implemented and MEASURED
 * rather than argued about, and it costs ten refusals on ordinary computed calls that have nothing
 * to do with this seam, so it is a stated door rather than a fence people would route around. In a multi-program DOCUMENT it does not: there, a computed key that does not
 * settle within its own script is refused outright, because a document's scripts can hand each other
 * state and three successive attempts to say which of them mattered were each defeated by an
 * ordinary page. The difference is not that a document is more dangerous, it is that a document is
 * where this reader was caught being silent, and silence is the failure it exists to prevent.
 *
 * It also has NO SCOPE. Any local that happens to share the seam's name is read as the seam, so a
 * parameter or variable of that name used as a value is flagged, and a call to it is classified.
 * Both directions are conservative, neither has an occupant here, and resolving them is the same
 * type checker as above. The folding map INHERITS that blindness: it is file-wide and the last
 * declaration in source order wins, so two same-named bindings in different scopes fold to whichever
 * is written later. It also reads `let` as well as `const`.
 *
 * An earlier version of this paragraph claimed a reassigned `let` folds to its first value and that
 * this is "the conservative direction". THAT WAS FALSE, and adversarial review executed the half it
 * got wrong. Folding to the first value is conservative only when the seam is written FIRST: then a
 * later reassignment leaves a call flagged that no longer reaches the seam, which is a false red and
 * loud. Written the other way round, `let m = "other"; m = "<seam>"; core[m]({creds})`, the map
 * answers `"other"`, the call is never recognised as the seam, and the file is never named. That is
 * the silent direction, and it is the one this file exists to refuse. A name BOUND MORE THAN ONCE
 * where any binding spells the seam is therefore refused outright, counting declarations and
 * assignments alike, so neither direction depends on which line came first.
 *
 * The name handed to a call AS DATA is an escape, and that rule has a cost worth stating so the
 * author who pays it knows it is the rule working: an ordinary assertion about the name, such as
 * `expect(fn.name).toBe("standaloneConnectOpts")`, is flagged. Measured across 906 files, the seam
 * name appears as an exact string literal in exactly ONE of them, this file's own seam table, so the
 * cost today is zero and the fail-closed direction is the right default for a reflective read.
 *
 * A file that does not PARSE is refused rather than scanned; see `sitesIn`. That is a change of
 * position rather than a limit: an unparseable file cannot execute, so declining to report a count
 * for it loses nothing, while scanning its error-recovery tree reports a number that looks like
 * coverage and answers about nodes no valid source can produce.

 *
 *  A file-wide map cannot answer this, and the two ways it fails are the two findings that produced
 *  this function. Claiming too much: `let tls = false; tls = undefined` passed as has-key, because a
 *  map keyed by name reads the declaration while the program runs on the assignment. Claiming too
 *  little, which is worse, because a false red teaches people to route around the check: two
 *  ordinary functions, each with its own local `tls`, one of them dead, and the dead one answers for
 *  the live call. Counting harder does not fix that second one, it only changes which red it is,
 *  since the two names are genuinely different bindings and no file-wide count can tell them apart.
 *
 *  So the walk goes outward from the use to the nearest scope that BINDS the name, and that scope
 *  alone answers. Bound once with no initializer or an undefined one: undefined, which is the value
 *  the seam throws on. Bound more than once, by any declaration or assignment: unsettled, refused in
 *  both directions rather than answered from whichever binding the text happens to show first. Bound
 *  by something this file cannot value, which is what a parameter, a destructured local, a catch
 *  variable or an import is: unknown, and untouched. That last case is the house idiom feeding
 *  `{ creds, tls }`, and it must stay green.
 *
 *  Residual, stated rather than papered over: a nested BLOCK binding is folded into its enclosing
 *  function rather than given its own scope, so a name declared in both is unsettled and refused
 *  where a full resolver would answer it. That is a refusal on a shadowing shape, in the direction
 *  that costs a verdict rather than the one that grants a pass.
 *
 *  Second residual, measured rather than assumed: an HTML file's script blocks are parsed as one
 *  program EACH here, so a value declared in an earlier block and read at a call in a later one is
 *  answered as bound nowhere and passes, where the same two lines inside one block are read and
 *  reddened. The KEY path already refuses across blocks, so this file pays that cost in one
 *  position and not the other.
 *
 *  Whether the miss is real depends on which kind of script, and the distinction is the reason this
 *  is stated carefully rather than loosely. CLASSIC scripts share one global lexical environment, so
 *  a top-level `const` in the first block IS the binding the second block reads, the value is
 *  undefined at the call, and passing it is a genuine miss. MODULE scripts do not see each other's
 *  `const` and `let` at all, so the name at the call is a free reference to something else entirely,
 *  and answering unknown is closer to right than wrong. A blunt fix, treating any name unbound in a
 *  multi-program file as unverifiable, would fail closed on both, which is the safe direction but
 *  buys a refusal on the module case to catch a classic case this repo has no occupant of. Named so

/** Is the thing being taken apart WRITTEN OUT here, wrapping calls included?
 *
 *  This is the question that decides refuse-versus-pass, so it is asked about the TEXT rather than
 *  about a route. Freeze was deepened and `Object.assign` was found fail-open behind it, so the rule
 *  stopped naming functions and started asking whether a call carried a literal, and four more
 *  routes were fail-open behind THAT: `new Wrapper({...})`, a ternary between two literals, `opts ??
 *  {...}`, and a comma operator. Each time the rule named a route, the next route was the finding.
 *  A literal anywhere in the initializer is text this reader is looking at, however it got there.
 *
 *  A literal inside a nested function body is deliberately not counted: it is a value that callback
 *  produces, not the structure this declaration takes apart. Unless the function is INVOKED right
 *  here, which is the distinction that decides it. `getOpts(() => ({ tls: undefined }))` hands a
 *  function to somebody else and the declaration takes apart whatever getOpts returns, so that
 *  literal is foreign. `(() => ({ tls: undefined }))()` takes apart what THAT function returns, so
 *  the literal in its body is the structure itself, and skipping it erased the only evidence the
 *  initializer was written here at all. Handed over and invoked are different acts.
 *
 *  Entering that body ARMS the refusal; it does not read the body. An invoked function is a call
 *  this file does not model, so an IIFE returning a perfectly good boolean is refused exactly as
 *  `structuredClone({ tls: false })` is, and for the same reason: reading a function's return means
 *  following what its body does, and guessing at that is how a refusal becomes a false pass.
 *
 *  Stated cost, on the refusing side. A call this file does not model, carrying a literal that is
 *  perfectly readable, is refused too: `structuredClone({ tls: false })` is unverifiable although
 *  nothing is wrong with it. Reading through it would mean assuming the call returns its argument
 *  unchanged, and that assumption is a false green waiting for the first function that transforms
 *  what it is handed, which is what functions are for. So the modelled calls are the ones whose
 *  semantics are actually known here, freeze and its family and the merge, and every other call
 *  carrying written text is refused rather than guessed at. That is a red on working code, which is
 *  the direction this reader is supposed to flinch from, and it is accepted here because the
 *  alternative is a pass on broken code and because a refusal says out loud that it did not read.
 *
 *  Stated consequence, since it is an asymmetry and not an oversight: where the initializer has
 *  BRANCHES, `cond ? { tls: false } : { tls: undefined }`, this refuses rather than folding them,
 *  while the ARGUMENT path does fold its alternatives. The two are answering different questions. An
 *  argument's alternatives are folded to decide whether the key is STATED, and a branch that omits
 *  it settles that. A source's branches hand over two different values, neither of which is the
 *  value at the call, so folding them would mean picking one. */
