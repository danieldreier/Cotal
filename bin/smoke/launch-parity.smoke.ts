/**
 * Launch-grammar parity smoke (CLI rework stage 2a). Three surfaces express "launch an agent":
 * the CLI's `spawn` (foreground + --detach — ONE flag list by construction), the manager's
 * `start` control op, and the MCP `cotal_spawn` tool. The tier rule forbids a shared import
 * between connector-core and workspace, so parity is enforced HERE, by test:
 *   1. `spawnFlags` ⊇ the shared `launchFlags` bundle (spawn parses the whole grammar).
 *   2. Every launch flag maps onto a manager `start`-op key (the golden op vocabulary).
 *   3. Every MCP `cotal_spawn` schema param IS one of those op keys (subset — the tool may
 *      expose less, e.g. no `resume` by design, but never a divergent name).
 *   4. Every launch client's request window OUTLIVES the manager's readiness wait (#159 B1) —
 *      the manager replies to `start`/`launch` only on a real outcome, so a client timeout at or
 *      under that window kills real spawns while the launch proceeds.
 * Run: pnpm smoke:launch-parity
