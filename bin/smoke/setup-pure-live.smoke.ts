/**
 * LIVE e2e for setup's state-independence (CLI rework stage 2b): `cotal setup --yes` runs as a
 * REAL subprocess in a sandboxed COTAL_HOME with claude/opencode OFF the PATH, and must:
 *   A. exit 0 — configuring a machine never depends on (or mutates) running state;
 *   B. LAUNCH NOTHING — no broker appears on the default port, no manager pid file lands;
 *   C. WRITE the default persona, install @cotal-ai/web in a sandboxed config dir, and write the
 *      onboarded stamp, with persona/stamp writes announced on stderr;
 *   D. `setup --demo` on an onboarded machine writes the guided team;
 *   E. a REPEAT run (now onboarded) prints the status card, still launches nothing, and exits 0;
 *   F. the removed `--open` flag and the deleted `go` command fail loud.
 * Run: pnpm smoke:setup-pure:live

// ── ANCHOR FIRST, and it is a containment boundary rather than a tidiness step ───────────────────
// `findCotalRoot` (auth-paths.ts:399-407) walks UP from cwd and returns the first ancestor holding a
// `.cotal`, falling back to cwd only when NO ancestor has one. The old comment here read "falls back
// to cwd" as though that were guaranteed; it is conditional on the box. `COTAL_HOME` does not enter
// this resolution at all, so sandboxing the home does NOT sandbox the root: on a box where a
// `.cotal` exists anywhere above the temp dir, every PROJECT-ROOT write this suite makes lands in
// THAT tree. Not every write: the onboarded stamp and the extension manifest are checked under
// `home`/`configHome` by the C-block's stamp and extension-manifest cells, and are sandboxed by
// COTAL_HOME/XDG_CONFIG_HOME, which root
// resolution never consults. The project-root case is not hypothetical — it is what happens on a
// developer box with a `/tmp/.cotal`, which is where broker credentials and logs live.
//
// Creating the anchor makes the intended resolution deterministic instead of ambient. The assertion
// below is the containment PRECONDITION and its regression guard, NOT a negative control: it checks
// only the anchored direction. The unanchored half is deliberately not asserted here, because
// "unanchored resolution escapes" is a property of the BOX — whether some ancestor of the temp dir
// happens to hold a `.cotal` — and not of this code; asserting it would make the suite pass or fail
// on the machine's layout. It was measured out-of-band instead.

// TWO probes, because the runtime artifacts no longer share one namespace.
//
// The RECORDS (`manager.pid`, `delivery.pid`, and their logs) are per-space now: the product writes
// them through `canonicalLocalProcessPath` (manager-proc.ts / delivery-proc.ts), so their names
// carry the injective hex space key and `runtimeRecord` calls the SAME function the product calls —
// not a hand-built lookalike. The space passed is the one a fresh, auth-less project resolves to.
//
// `nats.log`/`nats.pid` are still root-scoped and still written through `cotalPath` —
// `join(findCotalRoot(), ".cotal", …)` (paths.ts:12-13) — at up.ts:1965. `localProcessPath` is a
// DIFFERENT helper that yields the same `<root>/.cotal/<name>` shape, joining `.cotal`
// unconditionally and THROWING on an absolute or traversing template. Those two agree by layout,
// not by shared code, and it is the hand-built oracle in the CONTROL below that ties them — so that
// oracle is what makes this probe stand in for the product's path, and it must be re-derived if
// either helper's layout changes.
// Rebuilding these paths by hand is what let the B-cells below drift: they checked
// `join(home, "manager.pid")` — wrong root AND no `.cotal` segment — which no configuration can
// produce, so they could not fail and would have passed with a manager running.

// MUST-PASS CONTROLS, before any of the absence cells run. They are POSITIVE CONTROLS on the path
// SHAPE and on the detector. They prove NOTHING about whether the later absence cells were reached,
// and running before the first `cotal setup` subprocess (the A block below) they could not. Reach is
// carried by the exit code instead: `ok` THROWS on a red cell and the cells are straight-line
// top-level statements over
// fixed-size loops, so rc=0 means the last line executed and therefore every cell above it did. The
// printed completion count is a human-readable echo of that, not an enforced marker — nothing
// asserts it (package.json:268 is a bare `tsx` invocation).
//
// The plant/detect pair below is necessary but NOT sufficient, and saying so is the point: it writes
// a path and then reads THE SAME path, which is self-consistent for ANY writable location. It proves
// `writeFileSync`/`existsSync` work; it does NOT prove the path is the product's. That was measured,
// not reasoned — with `runtimeArtifact` redirected back to the old `join(home, name)`, the suite
// stayed green at 26/26 and both plant/detect cells passed, so the control as first written would
// NOT have caught the very drift it was added to catch.
//
// So pin the SHAPE of the resolved path first, against the layout `localProcessPath` documents
// (`<root>/.cotal/<name>`, local-process.ts:50). A wrong root or a lost `.cotal` segment reddens
// this cell, which is exactly the defect class the B-cells below drifted into.
