/**
 * Fail when a package's built `dist/` is older than its `src/`.
 *
 * In this repo a passing smoke means different things depending on where it lives, and nothing in
 * the output says which:
 *   - CORE smokes import `../src/index.js`. They read SOURCE and test your edit immediately.
 *   - MANAGER, CLI and DELIVERY smokes import `@cotal-ai/core`. That resolves through a relative
 *     symlink to `packages/core`, whose `exports` point at `dist/`. They test THE LAST BUILD.
 *
 * So "I edited core and the manager smoke passed" is not evidence about your edit unless you
 * rebuilt in between — and it reads exactly like evidence. That is not hypothetical: it is a claim
 * I made and had to retract tonight, having run a manager suite and a contract-import check against
 * a core that did not contain the change I was verifying. The conclusion happened to survive
 * because the full gate rebuilds first, but the intermediate evidence was worthless and looked
 * fine.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated before what it can. It compares the NEWEST mtime on each side, so it
 * proves an ORDERING and nothing else: a `dist` built from the wrong source passes as long as it is
 * newer, and one freshly-written output masks another that is stale. A deliberate
 * mutate-build-restore leaves `dist` NEWER than `src` and WRONG for the whole window, which is
 * exactly when it lies. Freshness is not correctness, and only a source/build identity manifest
 * would close that.
 *
 * BE HONEST ABOUT WHERE THIS BITES. `pnpm smoke:ci` builds before starting its shard, and the hosted
 * CI workflow likewise builds before invoking the shard directly, so this check is nearly inert in
 * those gates: it can only catch a build that silently produced nothing for a package. Its real use
 * is the ad-hoc case: run it after editing core and before trusting a manager-side suite. That makes
 * it a better instruction, not yet a ratchet, and the distinction matters because instructions are
 * the form that leaks — the person who most needs one is the person not thinking about it.
 *
 * THE VERSION THAT WOULD ACTUALLY RATCHET is a startup assertion inside every suite that reads
 * `dist`, so the check runs whether or not anyone remembered. 104 suites import `@cotal-ai/core`,
 * and there is no chokepoint to hang it on: the most-shared test helper reaches 16 of them. The one
 * universal path is core's own entry module, and that is the SHIPPED artifact (`files: ["dist"]`),
 * so a development-time check there would ride into every customer install. It would even no-op
 * safely, since a published install has no `src/` — which is exactly why it is tempting and exactly
 * why it does not go there. Recorded as a residual: the real fix is a shared smoke harness that
 * creates the chokepoint, which is a project rather than a patch.
 *
 * NOTE FOR THE NEXT PERSON WHO VERIFIES THIS CHECK: demonstrating it requires touching a source
 * file, which puts your own worktree into the state it detects. That is the check working, not a
 * defect. Content is unchanged, only the mtime moved, and the next build clears it.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:dist-freshness
