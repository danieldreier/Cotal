/**
 * Composition root for the `cotal` operator CLI, published as `cotal-ai`. Importing an
 * implementation self-registers its commands into the shared registry — base mesh commands
 * plus `spawn`/`console` (@cotal-ai/cli) and the manager's control plane + daemon runners
 * (@cotal-ai/manager). The root just picks which surfaces to pull in; `runCli` resolves
 * whatever registered. A new surface (another connector, a control client …) is one more import line.
 *
 * Reached only via ./cotal.ts, which runs the Node-version preflight first: everything imported
 * here requires Node >= 22 (the UI stack and the bundled nats-server optional dep), so this module
 * must never be the executable entry — importing it on an old Node crashes at parse time.

// NOTE: registration order across these imports is NOT guaranteed (tsx's entry interop can

// CPN's production control image is a deliberate composition root for the Kubernetes runtime.

// IMPORTED HERE BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE IN THIS PROCESS WOULD. The four agent connectors are removable
// ext plugins materialized lazily by `runCli`, and no `implementations/*` package imports
// connector-core at runtime — measured, not assumed. So a renderer that only registered inside the
// connector would be absent from every process that RENDERS, which is the one place it is needed.
// The seam is worth nothing if the provider never loads at the display site.
//
// The narrow subpath rather than the package root, deliberately: the root pulls the MCP server
// runtime and its zod copy into CLI startup, and a renderer needs none of it.

// materializes each lazily when a command resolves it; the default agent is `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT`
// (else claude), resolved manager-side. The old `"cotal"` default-agent alias is gone with them.
//
// Bare `cotal` prints help; explicit `cotal setup` runs guided setup. The published binary is
// the ONE composition root that loads operator-installed extensions (`cotal ext add …`) — commands,
// runtimes, connectors, and local process components all self-register from those packages. Library
// roots keep the explicit-import model.
