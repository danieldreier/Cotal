/**
 * Delivery cred-renewal smoke (D5 slice 5, class 2) — the EXPLICIT reload contract on the REAL
 * daemon (`bin/dist/cotal.js deliver`, built dist, isolated staged `.cotal` root). The renewal
 * owner's flow is played by a supervisor-cred endpoint (what the manager holds):
 *
 *   1. EXPLICIT ADOPTION: re-sign delivery.creds + membership-rw.creds for their EXISTING nkeys,
 *      request `reloadCreds` on the privileged delivery-admin rail → structured reply proves the
 *      daemon adopted BOTH (endpoint swap + membership rw reconnect), fresh exp windows returned.
 *   2. IDEMPOTENT ADOPTION: a reload on an unchanged-but-fresh file replies ok (the explicit path
 *      may race the 75% backstop that adopted the same re-sign — both succeeding is correct).
 *   3. BACKSTOP STAYS LOUD + HONEST FAILURE: with no re-sign, the 75% re-read fails loud on its own,
 *      and an explicit reload in that stale state replies ok:false naming the exact condition —
 *      "file written" can never masquerade as "daemon adopted".
 *   4. CLEAN SWAP: a final explicit reload before the old JWT's exp — the run never logs
 *      "User Authentication Expired" and ends with a READY delivery lease.
 *
 * NOTE: runs the BUILT dist — `pnpm build` first (the smoke:ci wiring builds).
 * Run: pnpm smoke:delivery-renewal   (needs `nats-server` on PATH; auth/JetStream, local-only; ~30s)
