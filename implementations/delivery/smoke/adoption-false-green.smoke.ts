/**
 * REGRESSION GATE: the class-2 adoption reply must be PROOF of broker adoption, never a false green.
 *
 * `Manager.renewDaemonCreds` re-signs the daemon creds and requests `reloadCreds` on the
 * delivery-admin rail, recording the reply as `adoption.ok` — which `cotal doctor auth` renders as
 * "daemon adopted". The shipped defect this file first reproduced: that reply was built from the
 * credential the daemon FETCHED, not one the broker ACCEPTED — `swapConnectionOntoFreshCreds` awaited
 * an `nc.reconnect()` that returns immediately and swallowed any refusal, so a re-signed-but-refused
 * cred read as adopted, and for DELIVERY the forced reconnect even STRANDED the admin rail the
 * failure would have travelled on.
 *
 * THE FIX this gate locks in: the proof-of-record is a DISPOSABLE PREFLIGHT connection presenting
 * exactly the candidate, run BEFORE the live cache is touched. So a broker-refused generation is a
 * STRUCTURED per-component FAILURE (never a green), the resident connection + admin rail are never
 * disturbed, and both components are proved INDEPENDENTLY (one failing neither masks nor is masked by
 * the other). The non-material error text keeps the secret-derived generation token off the wire and
 * out of the persisted renewal record.
 *
 * TWO scenarios, one per component (the fix covers BOTH; the no-fix-without-repro rule is per
 * component):
 *   A. DELIVERY rogue, membership trusted — delivery is refused (ok:false), membership adopts.
 *   B. MEMBERSHIP rogue, delivery trusted — membership is refused (ok:false), delivery adopts. The
 *      feed must START on a trusted cred first, or it is absent (a different defect, different fix).
 *
 * Each scenario gets its OWN broker, space, staged root, and daemon process. Sharing a space is not
 * an option: the delivery lease is per shard, so a second daemon in the same space refuses to bind.
 * Full isolation also keeps a broken connection in one scenario from contaminating the other.
 *
 * History: this began as the defect-POSITIVE repro (the false green reproduced on a real rail,
 * 14/14). With the fix in, the assertions are inverted — it now fails loudly if a rejected generation
 * is ever reported adopted, if one component's failure hides the other, if the rail self-strands, or
 * if a digest leaks.
 *
 * NOTE: runs the BUILT dist — `pnpm build` first.
 * Run: pnpm exec tsx implementations/delivery/smoke/adoption-false-green.smoke.ts
 *      (needs `nats-server` on PATH; local-only; ~60s)
