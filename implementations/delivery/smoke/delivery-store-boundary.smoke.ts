/**
 * Injected secret-store boundary smoke: with a store injected into `runDelivery`, the store is the
 * ONLY credential source. Locks the seam invariant the hosted composition relies on: local-source
 * flags (`--creds`, `--dev-mint`) are rejected AT THE BOUNDARY (before any ambient signer read —
 * including the `--dev-mint` space derivation), and an absent key is a hard error naming the key,
 * never a fall-through to a local mint. Every case throws before any connection, so this needs no
 * broker. The fake store also proves a hosted store is never written to by the read path.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:delivery-store-boundary
