/**
 * `epRailFailure` polarity smoke: the CLI's ep-rail renderer states the reachability verdict ("no
 * manager reachable" / "instance … did not answer") from core's answer-provenance markers, never from
 * the catalog code. Review of the manager-split lane found the code-keyed version printing "no
 * manager reachable" for a manager that had ANSWERED (a responder's own `ok:false` describe reply is
 * rethrown under its code, `unavailable` included; a store read after an answered describe raises the
 * same code) and for a registry read on the caller's own side (the scatter reconcile).
 *
 * Part 1 grades the renderer on hand-built errors, one cell per producer shape (each names the core
 * site it stands for). Part 2 drives the PUBLIC `askManager` against a real broker: a describe
 * responder that answers `ok:false unavailable` (the exact repro from review), a describe answered
 * `ok:true` whose cluster document is not in the store (the post-describe store read), and no
 * responder at all (the positive control for the verdict, unpinned and pinned).
