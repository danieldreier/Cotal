/**
 * `$SYS` ROTATION E2E (issue #338): the operator's whole recovery cycle, through the packaged
 * binary, against a real broker + a real delivery daemon + a real manager. Nothing here is staged in
 * process: every state transition is a `cotal` subprocess, and every assertion reads what that
 * subprocess left behind.
 *
 * `sys-rotation.smoke.ts` proves the mechanism (`rotateSystemCreds`, the refusal guards, the boot
 * split-check) and drives `up` in process. It cannot see any of the following, because all of it
 * lives in other processes:
 *
 *  - the reported SYMPTOM: with the $SYS pair past its 30-day horizon the real daemon's membership
 *    feed does not come up, and what it logs is now the credential and the repair rather than a bare
 *    "Authorization Violation";
 *  - the NO-OP that shipped as the fix: `cotal down` + a plain `cotal up` rewrites neither $SYS file
 *    leaves it byte-identical, still expired, doctor still red. This is the regression the branch exists to
 *    kill, so it is a check, not a comment;
 *  - the REPAIR: `cotal up --rotate-sys` clears the symptom in the daemon that reported it;
 *  - the SURVIVAL claim the repair copy makes to the operator. An agent credential minted before the
 *    rotation still connects afterwards, and a message published before it is still readable at its
 *    JetStream sequence after it. "Your agents and your data are untouched" is otherwise a promise
 *    with no test behind it.
 *
 * Elapsed time is the one thing simulated: the $SYS pair is minted with a past `exp`, which is the
 * state a 30-day-old mesh reaches on its own. It is signed by the space's CURRENT system account, so
 * what the daemon and the doctor react to is expiry, not the torn-pair case, which is
 * `sys-rotation.smoke.ts` stage 6.
 *
 * NOTE: runs the BUILT dist, so `pnpm build` first.
 * Run: pnpm smoke:sys-rotation-e2e   (needs `nats-server` on PATH; local-only; ~60s)
