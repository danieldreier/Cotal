/**
 * THE CLASS-QUEUE SPLIT, AGAINST A REAL MANAGER — AND WHAT THE FENCE MAKES OF IT.
 *
 * The production `invokeCommand` path carries the incarnation the caller resolved (`bind`, §13.3),
 * so a manager that is not that incarnation refuses BEFORE running the command. This drives that
 * against a manager started by `cotal up` on a live broker and grades the one claim no unit fixture
 * can make for the CLI: that the path an operator actually rides now returns a refusal PROVING
 * nothing ran, where it used to raise a report that could not say either way.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED HERE. This file used to assert the opposite outcome — that the same doctored invoke
 * THREW `failed-precondition` carrying `EP_UNBOUND_RESPONDER`, and that the CLI rendered that throw
 * as an answer rather than as silence. That was the best available before the fence: the split was
 * detected on the reply, so the throw was all there was. It is now a reply, and the assertions
 * below are the same experiment graded against the stronger result.
 *
 * FORCED, NOT RACED. Determinism comes from pointing the resolved handle's cached responder id at
 * an instance that does not exist, so whichever manager answers is not the bound incarnation on
 * every run. Waiting for a natural split would grade the same code on a coin flip, and
 * `smoke:queue-win` measured class-queue delivery as sticky on one box.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE. A responder that does not know the `bind` field ignores it (§5) and
 * runs the command, and the caller is back to the after-the-fact report — so `epRailFailure`'s
 * split branch stays live for version skew and stays graded in `smoke:ep-rail-failure`, on a
 * constructed error, because a current manager can no longer produce one. The `--on` remedy line
 * is likewise unreachable from a current CLI against a current manager; both are kept for the
 * skewed pair, not as dead code.
 *
 * Open mode (no creds); sandboxes COTAL_HOME + a temp root; tears down with `cotal down`, never
 * pkill. Needs `nats-server` on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:bind-fence:live
