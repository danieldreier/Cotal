/**
 * A1 end-to-end: a machine joins a broker it does not run.
 *
 * The shape this proves is the whole point, so it is worth stating before the code. An always-on
 * box runs the broker AND the control plane (delivery daemon + manager). Another machine holds the
 * space's trust material, registers the mesh, and from then on its agents are ordinary peers.
 * It elects no lease and runs no daemon. Joining is the participant path: it installs the trust
 * material and registry record needed to connect agents to a control plane hosted elsewhere. It does
 * not confer manager or delivery authority on the joining machine. Hosting a control plane on that
 * machine is Track A2, outside this test.
 *
 * The two machines are simulated by two roots with two separate COTAL_HOME registries, because a
 * single-home test would silently share the registry and hide exactly the asymmetry under test.
 *
 * Ports are OS-assigned (`pickFreePort`), so this can never touch a real mesh on 4222.
 * Needs `nats-server` on PATH, as the rest of smoke:ci does.
 * Run: pnpm smoke:join-external:live
