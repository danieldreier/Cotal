/**
 * The join dial policy: which broker addresses a machine may send its agent credentials to.
 *
 * A machine joining a broker it does not run puts its credentials in the CONNECT line. NATS sends
 * the initial INFO in plaintext and unauthenticated, so an on-path attacker forges one without
 * `tls_required` and reads them. The client side is the only fence, and the URL SCHEME IS NOT IT:
 * measured against `@nats-io/transport-node` 3.4.0 pointed at a broker with no TLS configured,
 * `tls://host:port` connects happily; only the explicit `tls` connect option refuses. So until the
 * broker-TLS transport lands, the join classifies its target and refuses what it cannot protect.
 *
 * The interesting cases are the ones that LOOK safe: a private RFC1918 address on hostile wifi, a
 * hostname that resolves to loopback today, an address that merely starts with the right digits.
 *
 * Hermetic (no broker, no network, no filesystem).
