/**
 * `$SYS` credential rotation smoke (issue #338): the class-3 renewal that `renewal.ts` cannot do.
 *
 * `membership-observer.creds` and `connection-evictor.creds` carry a 30-day expiry and are
 * `rotation-renewed`: no resident process re-signs them. The bug this pins was that the only repair
 * the tooling named ("`cotal down` then a fresh `cotal up`") did NOTHING: `up` mints the $SYS pair
 * only on the branch that CREATES the trust record, so re-upping an existing space reused the same
 * expired files and reported success, while the delivery daemon's membership feed stayed dead and
 * every `membership-rw` adoption was refused.
 *
 * Three layers:
 *
 *  1. `rotateSystemCreds` on a staged root: the generation advances, BOTH files are rewritten, and
 *     the data account + operator seed are untouched (this is why the repair is safe to run on a
 *     live space). A rotation for a space with no trust record throws instead of inventing one.
 *  2. Record/creds are ONE generation: the persisted trust record's system account is the issuer of
 *     the creds on disk. A writer that persisted the creds from a different (or pre-rotation) bundle
 *     would split them and hand the broker creds it will never honor.
 *  3. Live broker: started from the ROTATED config it REJECTS the pre-rotation observer, ACCEPTS
 *     both rotated $SYS creds, and still accepts a data-account cred minted BEFORE the rotation,
 *     which is the "your agents survive this" claim the repair copy makes, proven rather than asserted.
 *
 * Plus the copy-to-behavior link: `doctor auth`'s repair for an EXPIRED $SYS cred must name
 * `--rotate-sys`. That string regressing back to a bare `up` is the original bug, so it is a check.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:sys-rotation   (needs nats-server on PATH)
