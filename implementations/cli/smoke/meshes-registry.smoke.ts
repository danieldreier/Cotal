/**
 * `cotal meshes add | rm` and the record-origin rule they rest on.
 *
 * The registry used to be written only by `cotal up`, which meant (a) a mesh running on another
 * machine could not be registered at all, and (b) the liveness sweep deleted records nothing on
 * this machine could write back — a sleeping laptop silently unregistered a healthy remote mesh.
 * So the load-bearing assertions here are the ones about ORIGIN:
 *
 *  • an `up` record whose broker is dead is pruned; a `manual` one is KEPT and reported `offline`,
 *    on that sweep and on every later one;
 *  • `add` verifies against the real broker before recording, and records nothing when that fails;
 *  • `--force` is the explicit record-without-verifying / replace escape;
 *  • `rm` drops records, releases the `current` pointer, and refuses a mesh running here.
 *
 * Needs `nats-server` on PATH (as the rest of smoke:ci does) for the live-broker probes.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT: the live broker here is open and JetStream-less, so the AUTH admission path is
 * covered only by its refusals (a broker that enforces nothing, a root whose trust does not
 * compose). A positive auth registration against a provisioned mesh belongs with the provisioning
 * smokes (`multi-space`), not here — this file must not be read as proving that path works.
 * Run: pnpm smoke:meshes-registry
