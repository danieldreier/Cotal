/**
 * RENEWAL-RECORD HONESTY (W3 3a, freelance blockers 1 + 4) — broker-free. Two invariants the
 * adoption-proof slice must never regress:
 *
 *  1. The ephemeral generation FINGERPRINT (SHA-256 of the re-signed JWT) NEVER reaches disk. It is
 *     the expected-generation token the renewal owner hands the daemon; a stable secret-derived
 *     token on disk is a leak. `writeRenewalRecord` redacts at the single persistence boundary, so
 *     EVERY writer (manager AND `doctor auth --fix`) is covered even when the in-memory result
 *     carries a fingerprint. We assert the raw JSON has no `fingerprint` key and no 64-hex digest.
 *
 *  2. A broker-REFUSED renewal is a first-class doctor problem: `cotal doctor auth` must exit 1 and
 *     say so, never let cred-file health alone stand as `auth: healthy` / exit 0. The mirror case —
 *     a broker-ACCEPTED renewal with no cred problems — must still exit healthy, proving the exit-1
 *     is the refusal itself, not merely the presence of a renewal record.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:renewal-record-honesty
