// took the manifest details out of the action acceptance floor), the writer kept reading them from
// the reply through an `as`, `JSON.stringify` dropped the undefined keys, and the row hit disk
// structurally valid and semantically unreadable. It surfaced at teardown as an accusation that the
// operator had edited their manifest.
//

// the cell: a hand-built "bad" row would only prove the validator rejects what I chose to write.

// READABLE ROW? Any field the writer sources from a reply that stops carrying it fails here, at the
