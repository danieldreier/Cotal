/**
 * `cotal doctor auth` smoke (D5 slice 6) — broker-free. Two layers:
 *
 *  1. `inspectCredHealth` (core) is pinned pure: healthy / near-expiry (past 75% of iat→exp) /
 *     expired / unbounded / unreadable, with an injected clock.
 *  2. The doctor command runs against a STAGED `.cotal` folder (real crypto: createSpaceAuth +
 *     mintCreds): an expired delivery cred and an unbounded standing membership-rw cred are
 *     problems with exact repairs; a static agent cred is NOT a problem (pre-flip, dim); a missing
 *     file is a note, not a failure. `--fix` re-signs the class-2 files for their EXISTING nkeys
 *     (the identity pin) and the re-diagnosis ends `healthy`.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:doctor-auth
