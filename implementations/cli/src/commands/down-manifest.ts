/**
 * `cotal down -f cotal.yaml` — ownership-scoped teardown of a `spawn -f` deploy: stop + remove ONLY
 * the agents/channels that run created, never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is
 * treated as untrusted input and the WHOLE of it is validated + every path resolved up front, before
 * any destructive action (fail closed). Local-only: works from the same checkout/host that created
 * the run (the ledger is local state).
 *
 * Safety invariants (security/critic/UX early-PR2 review):
 *  - find the ledger by manifest hash; an edited file / >1 match FAILS with `--run`, never guesses;
 *  - stop an owned agent only when the live agent matches the recorded name AND nkey id — a name
 *    match with a different id is left alone (foreign reuse), never stopped by name;
 *  - cred paths are DERIVED from the auth root (never read from the ledger) and deleted no-follow;
 *  - a ledger-owned channel card is removed only when no members remain and membership is knowable —
 *    skipped (best-effort, racy) on ANY uncertainty, including an owned agent that failed to stop;
 *  - `--allow-stale` is apply-only and has no effect here.
