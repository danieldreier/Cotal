/**
 * `cotal spawn -f cotal.yaml` — deploy a mesh manifest onto a RUNNING mesh (additive). The only
 * command that touches a mesh it doesn't own, so it is creation-only + ownership-scoped:
 *
 *  - classifies channels (new → seed + own · existing → `exists-unmanaged`, card untouched) and
 *    agents (will-create · already-owned · stale) against the live mesh + any prior ledger;
 *  - boots agents through the serving manager's admin `launch` op — a manager in THIS checkout
 *    reads the run spec by id; a manager in another checkout/host gets the resolved spec pushed
 *    inline over the control plane (it validates + persists it itself, and mints from the resolved
 *    policy — the control wire carries no authority, and never a path);
 *  - records exactly what it created in a `cotal-ledger/v1` ledger so `down -f` removes only that;
 *  - flags unmanaged actors on declared channels as a SECURITY warning (an explicit lower bound).
 *
 * `--dry-run` prints the plan and mutates nothing; a stale declared agent exits non-zero unless
 * `--allow-stale <names>`.
