/**
 * The guided form of `cotal meshes add` — a bare `cotal meshes add` on a terminal.
 *
 * It exists because the flag form asks the operator to already know four things: the broker
 * address, whether that broker authenticates, which space name to use, and that credentials must
 * be copied locally first. Three of those the machine can find out, so this asks for the ONE that
 * cannot be derived (the address), then probes and reports what it learned. Every question after
 * that is a choice between real options rather than free text: the space names come from the trust
 * actually on disk, and the mode is stated as a fact about the broker, never asked.
 *
 * The rules are not re-implemented here. Every decision goes through `meshes-add.ts`, so the
 * guided and flag forms cannot drift; this module owns presentation and recovery only — which
 * failures offer a way out (a wrong URL is worth retyping; a mesh that is simply down is worth
 * recording anyway) instead of ending the command.
 */

/**
 * The prompts, as an interface rather than direct clack calls.
 *
 * Not indirection for its own sake: the wizard's VALUE is its control flow — does a name that came
 * from the command line still hit the clash gate, does "point at a different folder" actually ask
 * for one, does a replacement still get verified — and every one of those questions was answered
 * wrong at least once. None of it is reachable by a test that cannot answer a prompt, so the review
 * that caught those bugs was doing work the suite structurally could not. With the prompts injected,
 * a test drives the real function with scripted answers and asserts what it asked and what it wrote.
