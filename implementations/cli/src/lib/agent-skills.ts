/**
 * Cross-vendor Agent Skills distribution.
 *
 * Cotal authors a small set of Agent Skills (SKILL.md, the agentskills.io open format). One canonical
 * copy of each ships inside this CLI package (see package.json `files`) and feeds three delivery
 * channels from that single source:
 *   1. Claude Code, bundled in the `cotal-skills` plugin, installed from the mesh marketplace at user
 *      scope (real remote update via a release-derived plugin version; see setup.ts).
 *   2. Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Windsurf/Devin read the cross-vendor `~/.agents/skills/`
 *      directory convention. Codex reads its native `$CODEX_HOME/skills` root (normally
 *      `~/.codex/skills`). No remote index reaches either location, so `cotal setup` reconciles both
 *      and `cotal status` reports skew. This module owns those reconciles.
 *   3. The website Agent Skills discovery index, generated from the same canonical files at build.
 *
 * File-level ownership (the safety model): Cotal owns `SKILL.md` in each managed root and, only when
 * shipped, the Codex-native `agents/openai.yaml` interface file. Every owned file is tracked by digest
 * in a validated manifest under `~/.cotal`. Cotal never recursively deletes a skill directory (a
 * retired skill's dir is removed only if it is left empty), never touches any other file a user or third
 * party put there, refuses to follow a symlink anywhere in a managed path, and writes via a
 * stage-and-rename so it replaces the directory entry instead of writing through a hard-linked inode.
 * That keeps a destructive reconcile from becoming a data-loss or arbitrary-write primitive.
