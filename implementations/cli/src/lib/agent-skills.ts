/**
 * Cross-vendor Agent Skills distribution.
 *
 * Cotal authors a small set of Agent Skills (SKILL.md, the agentskills.io open format). One canonical
 * copy of each ships inside this CLI package (see package.json `files`) and feeds three delivery
 * channels from that single source:
 *   1. Connector-declared harness adapters receive the canonical directory through the generic
 *      setup-provider seam; each adapter owns its native packaging and update path.
 *   2. Every other harness (Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Windsurf/Devin) reads the cross-vendor
 *      `~/.agents/skills/` directory convention. No remote index reaches them today, so `cotal setup`
 *      (and `cotal setup --skills`) reconciles the files here and `cotal status` reports skew. This module owns that reconcile.
 *   3. The website Agent Skills discovery index, generated from the same canonical files at build.
 *
 * File-level ownership (the safety model): Cotal owns exactly ONE file per skill it ships,
 * `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, tracked by digest in a validated manifest under `~/.cotal`. It
 * only ever writes/removes that file: it never recursively deletes a skill directory (a retired skill's
 * dir is removed only if it is left empty), never touches any other file a user or third party put
 * there, refuses to follow a symlink anywhere in the managed path, and writes via a stage-and-rename so
 * it replaces the directory entry instead of writing through a hard-linked inode. That keeps a
 * destructive reconcile from becoming a data-loss or arbitrary-write primitive.
