/**
 * The `spawn -f` ownership ledger (`cotal-ledger/v1`, one file per run at
 * `.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`): the durable, creation-only record of exactly what a `spawn -f`
 * deploy added to a shared mesh — the registry keys it created and the agents it spawned (by the
 * manager-reply **spawned** name + nkey id). `down -f` reads it to tear down *only* those resources.
 *
 * Two hard rules, because a tampered ledger could otherwise become arbitrary process/credential/file
 * deletion (the round-8/9 security review):
 *   1. **Store IDs, never arbitrary paths.** Cred paths are *derived* from the known auth root at
 *      teardown ({@link ownedCredPath}); the run dir is `.cotal/run/<runId>`. The ledger never names
 *      a path to delete.
 *   2. **Treat the file as untrusted on read.** {@link loadLedger} strictly validates the whole
 *      ledger (schema, token-safe ids/names, concrete channels, duplicate detection) BEFORE the
 *      caller takes any destructive action — fail closed, globally.
