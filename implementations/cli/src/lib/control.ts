 * credential knows which instance rails it carries; core cannot know, and a core that guessed would
 * publish requests the broker must refuse — invisibly, since a refused publish looks exactly like a
 * slow instance from the caller's side.
 *
 * TWO RULES, and both are about not asking questions this credential cannot ask:
 *  - an id OUTSIDE the pinned set gets `unknown` WITHOUT PUBLISHING. The scatter re-freezes the
 *    class on its own connection, so it can name an instance that registered after the freeze this
 *    credential was minted against. That instance is NEW, not dead, and the right answer for it is
 *    the deadline — reached without sending a request that would be refused.
 *  - an id INSIDE the set that the broker refuses anyway settles IMMEDIATELY on the violation
 *    rather than expiring into `unknown` at the budget, and is reported by name.
 *
 * Only `gone` ever licenses anything downstream, so every mistake this can make is a slower and
 * more truthful answer, never a faster wrong one.

 *   0. FREEZE the live class from the records registry (the same §13.9 read the scatter itself
 *      does), then close. This yields the exact instance ids this invocation will address.
 *   1. RE-MINT the one-shot instrument LOCALLY, pinned to exactly those ids, and run the
 *      unpinned {@link resolveService} + {@link scatterCommand} on it — now the §13.5 liveness probe
 *      can publish on each frozen instance's own rail and the gather can end as soon as every slot
 *      has either answered or been affirmed gone by the broker.
 *
 * THE COST IS THE MINT, NOT A ROUND TRIP. `mintCreds` is a local JWT signature against the space
 * seed already in hand (measured at 22-45ms here); the extra connection is the only wire cost. The
 * earlier attempt at this measured 3.2s because it re-ran the whole target resolve (registry read,
 * preflight, stale-prune) to get a pinned credential, and shipped a regression to fix a hypothesis.
 * This re-mints and nothing else.
 *
 * NO WILDCARD INSTANCE ROW is minted, which is the invariant the whole two-connection shape exists
 * to preserve: the pin is a list of exact ids known before the mint, the same precondition `--on`
 * satisfies with one id.
 *
 * WHERE THERE IS NO SEED THERE IS NO PROBE, and the deadline stands. A user-mode bearer and a raw
 * off-registry cred cannot re-mint, so their frozen slots are `not-probed` and say so. This is not
 * a silent degrade: it is the pre-existing behaviour, and the row prints which of the two it is.
