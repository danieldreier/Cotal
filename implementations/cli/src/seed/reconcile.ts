/**
 * The connector seeding reconcile: makes the four first-party connectors present on a fresh install
 * (and re-present after a version bump) through the SAME `ext add` path a third party uses, while
 * honoring deliberate removals. It runs on the first real command of a boot (never `postinstall`),
 * and on `cotal ext seed`.
 *
 * Safety spine:
 *  - ONE reconcile lock (shared crash-safe advisory lock) + the extension mutation lock, held for the
 *    whole run, so neither a second reconcile nor an operator `ext add`/`remove` interleaves. A live
 *    reconcile is WAITED on (bounded), never mistaken for a crash.
 *  - a crash cursor journaled before every mutation and kept until the FINAL commit, so a SIGKILL
 *    mid-run is detected on the next boot (fail loud + `--repair`) and `--repair` actually re-installs
 *    the interrupted connector before it clears the evidence — never a success reported over torn files.
 *  - a seed-child liveness marker, so a reclaim/repair after a parent SIGKILL refuses to race an
 *    orphaned installer still mutating the prefix.
 *  - a health preamble BEFORE the stamp fast path, so a lost authority can't hide behind a current
 *    stamp; the ever-seeded authority (unioned with its monotonic backup on read) is the sole arbiter
 *    of removed-vs-never-seeded.
 *  - refresh gated on the manifest entry's `source`: only connectors WE seeded auto-refresh on an
 *    upgrade; an operator-managed official entry (a manual `ext add` at a chosen version) is left alone.
