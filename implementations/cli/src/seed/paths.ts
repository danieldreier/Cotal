 *
 * The seed store is DURABLE by design: `npm install --install-links <dir>` normalizes a `file:` dep
 * pointing at `<dir>`, so a volatile source (an `npx` `_npx` cache) would later fail to reify. We
 * copy each shipped connector payload into `store/<generation>/<name>` and `ext add` from THAT stable
 * path, keyed by the binary's version so a `cotal-ai` upgrade lands a fresh generation.
