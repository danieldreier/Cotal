 * in it but absent from the extensions manifest was removed on purpose (leave it removed); a name
 * NOT in it was never seeded (seed it). Losing this set would resurrect removals, so it is mirrored
 * into an append-only backup — the only thing `--repair` can recover from. Write order per reconcile:
 * authority (with its backup) first, then the witness, then the stamp LAST, so a stamp is never
