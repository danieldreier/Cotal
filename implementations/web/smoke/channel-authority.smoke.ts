/**
 * The dashboard must route on the channel the BROKER POLICED, not the one the publisher claimed.
 *
 * A publish grant is per-channel (`chat.<owner>.<actor>.<ch>`), so the channel token in the subject
 * is covered by the minted grant. `msg.channel` is a payload field and is backed by nothing: the
 * broker polices which SUBJECT a principal may publish to, and does not police a payload field. The
 * observer took `parseSubject(subject).sender` — explicitly calling it "the verified publisher …
 * vs the advisory `from` in the payload" — and then did not take `.rest`, so the channel list,
 * per-channel counts, unread badges and the transcript were all keyed on the publisher's claim.
 *
 * ⚠️ `.rest` IS NOT ALWAYS A CHANNEL. On `chat` it is; on `inst` it is the RECIPIENT and on `svc`
 * the ROUTE (`packages/core/src/subjects.ts:593-604`). Forwarding it ungated would label a DM's
 * recipient as a channel, so the kind-gate is load-bearing rather than defensive, and it is driven
 * below rather than asserted.
 *
 * WHAT IS DRIVEN, AND WHAT IS NOT.
 *   - Block 1 drives the real `parseSubject` / `chatSubject` from `@cotal-ai/core`.
 *   - Block 2 EXTRACTS the shipped decision statements — the server's derivation and all four
 *     browser ingresses — out of the files that ship them, and EXECUTES them. It does not match
 *     their text. A substring check proves a line was TYPED; it goes red on a harmless reformat and
 *     stays green on a statement that no longer does what its name says. Neither page can be
 *     evaluated whole (both drive the DOM at load), so the statement is extracted rather than the
 *     file imported — it is still shipped source, never a copy.
 *   - NOT DRIVEN, and no cell here implies it: that a publisher can set `msg.channel` to one value
 *     while publishing on another subject and have it survive the send path. That needs a live
 *     broker and two principals. These cells stand on the narrower fact that the verified value is
 *     present, parseable, and now used.
 *
 * Trust is resolved ONCE PER INGRESS rather than at each read. Four ingresses exist — a live feed
 * and a backfill in each browser file — and a reader three functions away cannot know which value
 * it holds. Overwriting at the boundary means downstream `msg.channel` IS the verified one, so
 * there is one place to audit instead of every use site.

// ── EXTRACTING A STATEMENT IS A PARSE, AND A REGEX IS THE WRONG PARSER ───────────────────────────
// This helper exists because the previous form of these two SSE cells SURVIVED a real mutation, and
// the survival is the whole argument for the rewrite.
//
// The pattern was `/^ *(?:if \([^)]*\) )?msg\.channel = entry\.channel;/m` — an optional one-line
// guard in front of the assignment. Rewrite the shipped guard with BRACES:
//     if (entry.channel) {
//       msg.channel = entry.channel;
//     }
// and the inner assignment sits alone on its own line, so the pattern matches it with the optional
// group ABSENT. The cell then executes a bare unconditional assignment — which is exactly the
// correct behaviour — while the shipped file does the opposite. Positive cell green, hostile cell
// green, 63/63, rc=0, with a fail-open surface shipped. MEASURED, not reasoned: reproduced by
// bracing both live ingresses and re-running this suite.
//
// So the rule earned here: **anchoring a pattern is not the same as capturing a statement.** The
// earlier hardening added the optional-guard prefix and claimed "capture the whole statement"; that
// claim was FALSE the moment the control-flow context was a block rather than a line, because a
// guard's own body is a syntactically complete statement that behaves correctly in isolation.
// Any fix that stays in regex-space has the same hole one reformat away.
//
// The answer is to stop extracting a statement at all and execute the whole CONTAINING FUNCTION, so
// every guard around the assignment is inside the code under test by construction. Brace-matching
// from the function header is a structural parse: it cannot return a fragment.
//
// ⚠️ BUT "NOT A FRAGMENT" IS NOT "IS CODE", AND THAT DISTINCTION COST THIS SUITE A SECOND FALSE
// GREEN. `indexOf` takes the FIRST textual occurrence of the header, and a copy of the function
// sitting inside a COMMENT is a first occurrence. MEASURED: with a commented copy of the safe
// function placed above the real one, and the real one regressed to the guarded (vulnerable) clear,
// `node --check` passed and this suite printed **82 checks passed, rc=0** — grading the comment
// while the shipped page was exploitable. A positive control proves a pattern CAN match something;
// it does NOT prove what it matched is CODE.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE FIRST REMEDY FOR THAT WAS ITSELF DEFEATED — TWICE. It counted raw `/*` and `*/`
// before the header and required one exact textual spelling. Both halves were exploitable:
//   - a plain `const x = "*/";` in ordinary source makes the raw counts BALANCE at a header that
//     really is inside a comment, so the "not in a comment" check returns false for a commented
//     copy; and
//   - the uniqueness pin was tied to one spelling, so changing the REAL declaration to
//     `function onMessage (entry) {` (one space) left the expected header occurring exactly once —
//     inside the comment.
// Together: `node --check` valid, both anchor cells green, **101 checks passed, rc=0**, and the
// shipped handler still retaining `victim-channel` on non-chat messages.
//
// THE DEFENCE OF "NOT A FULL TOKENIZER" DID NOT HOLD, AND THAT IS THE LESSON. Counting raw
// delimiters IS a partial tokenizer — one that silently mis-reads ordinary JavaScript strings. The
// choice was never "heuristic vs tokenizer"; it was "an unreliable tokenizer I wrote vs a correct
// one already in the toolchain". A REMEDY IS NOT EXEMPT FROM THE CLASS IT REMEDIES, and the third
// version of this guard is the first that stops guessing.
//
// So: use TypeScript's own parser, which is already a dependency. Comments are NOT AST nodes, so a
// commented copy is invisible here BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a check that can be balanced out;
// string contents are tokenized properly; and the match is on the DECLARATION, so whitespace
// spelling is irrelevant. This cannot return a fragment, a comment, or a string.

 *  and graded as though it ran, while the shipped page performs no overwrite at all.
 *
 *  So its presence is a REFUSAL, not something to blank or to enumerate. The match is deliberately
 *  crude and unanchored: a false positive (the sequence inside a string) refuses and costs a red
 *  cell, while a false negative grades a page that does not exist. Those are not symmetric, and the

// predecessor had not listed. The last two are the reason the approach changed rather than grew:
// a leading `#!` hashbang and the classic-script `<!--` form are BOTH accepted by the browser that
// runs these files, and NEITHER is a comment range, so a comment-blanker leaves them searchable.
// Enumerating trivia is a losing game; a `ForOfStatement` is not something trivia can be.
//
// Each control is built from a SYNTHETIC source rather than the file under test: deriving a control
// from the file means a mutation to that file changes the control too, which has already happened
// here — a decoy made a control fire instead of the behaviour cell it exists to protect, masking
// which cell caught the regression.
