/**
 * THE ONE WRITE ROUTE READ AS MUCH AS THE CALLER CARED TO SEND.
 *
 * `POST /api/channel/delete` is the dashboard's only write path. It read its body by pushing every
 * chunk into an array and concatenating, with no cap and no look at `content-length`, so the
 * ceiling on a request was the process heap.
 *
 * MEASURED against the shipped route on a local broker before this existed, with a raw socket
 * rather than `fetch`, because `fetch` hides how much of the body actually left the client and
 * that is half the question:
 *
 *   30,000,000 bytes posted   ALL 30,000,000 sent, 70,000,144 bytes of refusal returned,
 *                             peak RSS +1.39 GB, 1022 ms.
 *
 * The read ran to completion before the route formed any opinion, so the refusal was the expensive
 * part rather than the cheap one, and the amplification rode on top: a refusal echoes the name it
 * refuses, and an escaped U+2028 leaves as seven bytes for the three that arrived.
 *
 * WHAT THE CAP HAS TO BE, and why each half is here rather than only the obvious one:
 *
 *   refuse AT the threshold        not after reading to the end and then complaining, or the
 *                                  memory is already spent when the refusal is written.
 *   never truncate to the cap      a shortened channel name is a name the caller did not send,
 *                                  which is the aliasing shape the validator on this same route
 *                                  exists to refuse (Cotal #711). A cap that truncates would
 *                                  reintroduce it through the back door.
 *   stay a ceiling, not a trigger  an ordinary delete, and a padded one nowhere near the cap,
 *                                  must be untouched.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT CLAIM. It does not claim the caller always READS the 413. It cannot: a
 * server that cuts a caller off mid-upload leaves unread bytes in the socket, that close goes out
 * as an RST, and an RST makes the peer drop the response it had already buffered. The refusal that
 * is never lost is the OPERATOR LINE, which is written before the response is, and that is what
 * cell 3.3 pins.
 *
 * Needs nats-server on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:web-body-cap
