/**
 * THE CONSOLE'S HTTP SURFACE AUTHENTICATES A CALLER, AND EACH REFUSAL SAYS WHICH CONDITION FAILED.
 *
 * Measured before this change, on the shipped file: `req.headers` was read **0 times** (control:
 * `req.url`, 3 times). Not weak authentication — none. The surface binds loopback, and loopback
 * defends against other HOSTS; it does not defend against another PROCESS on this machine, and it
 * does not defend against a page in the operator's own browser issuing requests to
 * `http://127.0.0.1:7799`. What that reached was the whole mesh read path plus a channel-delete POST.
 *
 * This is slice 1 of the send work and deliberately contains NO send route. It is worth landing on
 * its own: the hole it closes exists today, and every later slice depends on the caller being known.
 *
 * WHAT IS DRIVEN, IN TWO LAYERS, BECAUSE ONE IS NOT ENOUGH:
 *   1. The exported `makeAuthGate` — what the gate decides.
 *   2. The gate block LIFTED OUT of the shipped `handleRequest` and executed — what the handler DOES
 *      with each verdict, over a recording `ServerResponse`.
 * Layer 2 exists because a suite on this surface has already been caught asserting what a function
 * was CALLED WITH rather than what it DID (PR #450, mutation 8). A correct gate wired to a handler
 * that ignores its verdict is an unauthenticated surface with a passing test.
 *
 * NOT DRIVEN, and no cell implies it: a real browser's cookie jar, and a real cross-site request. The
 * `SameSite=Strict` attribute is asserted as EMITTED, not as ENFORCED — enforcement is the browser's
 * and needs a browser. That boundary is stated rather than left for a reader to assume.

// ── 4b2. THE GATE THE HANDLER ACTUALLY CLOSES OVER (INTERIM GUARD) ──────────────────────────────
// A hole this suite CANNOT close from here, stated rather than papered over. Everything above builds
// its own gate; the shipped handler closes over the one created inside `web()`. Overwriting that one
// — `const gate = makeAuthGate(port); gate.check = () => undefined;` — opens the entire surface and
// leaves every cell green, because no cell here ever touches web()'s closure. Measured on a real
// gate: `check` goes from `{refuse:"unauthenticated"}` to `undefined`, i.e. allow-everything.
//
// The durable fix is an integration cell against the REAL server, which needs a running mesh and is
// NOT done here. This is an INTERIM structural guard: it pins the gate's creation and its ADJACENCY
// to the handler, so a statement inserted between them is caught.
//
// ITS BOUNDARY IS MEASURED, not estimated: the SAME overwrite moved BELOW the handler, just above
// `createServer`, leaves the adjacency intact and SURVIVES 128/128. So this guard catches insertion
// between the gate and the handler and nothing else. Anyone reading it should know that, which is
// why the survivor is written down here instead of being left for the next reviewer to rediscover.
//
// ── THE FOUR KNOWN SURVIVORS, AND WHAT EACH ONE MEASURES ────────────────────────────────────────
// Independent adversarial review reproduced the boundary above and found three more bypasses. All
// four are recorded here, each with the survivor written beside the guard it walks past, because a
// limitation discovered twice is a limitation that was never written down. EVERY ONE of them was
// applied to a clean tree, ran `128 passed, 0 failed` (rc=0 from an EXIT-trap artifact) AND passed
// `pnpm --filter @cotal-ai/web typecheck` (rc=0), then was restored with the source blob verified by
// hash. So each is a COMPILING, TEST-PASSING bypass: the compiler is not a backstop for any of them.
//
// (1) web.ts, below the handler: `gate.check = () => undefined;`
//     SURVIVES. The adjacency guard below sees nothing between the gate and the handler.
//     Non-equivalence proven on a real gate: shipped `check` returns `{refuse:"unauthenticated"}`
//     for a bare request and `{refuse:"cross-origin"}` for a foreign Origin; the mutant returns
//     `undefined` for every input, i.e. every named refusal becomes a silent allow.
//
// (2) web.ts, before the gate-creation line: a nested, explicitly typed function ALSO named
//     `makeAuthGate` whose `check` always allows.
//     SURVIVES, and it defeats the text pins on their own terms: the gate-creation text and the
//     gate-to-handler adjacency stay BYTE-IDENTICAL while the binding changes. The cells resolve
//     this module's top-level import; the production closure resolves the nested declaration.
//     THE GENERAL LESSON, worth more than this cell: exact text is fail-closed against harmless
//     reformatting, but it does NOT establish identifier identity.
//
// (3) web.ts refusal write: end the body BEFORE the status write.
//     SURVIVES, because both response recorders in this file (see the `writeHead`/`end` fakes)
//     retain only FINAL field values and do not model CALL ORDER. Measured on a live Node HTTP
//     server: shipped ordering returns 401, the swapped ordering returns **200** with body
//     `{"error":"unauthenticated"}` — the later `writeHead` throws ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT after the
//     body is already on the wire. So the condition is still NAMED in the body but is no longer
//     client-distinguishable from success by status. A fixture that records status-at-end rather
//     than call order cannot see this, which is exactly why it is a limitation and not a cell.
//
// (4) web.ts `createServer` listener: emit a 200 JSON empty result and return before
//     `handleRequest`.
//     SURVIVES because ZERO cells in this suite drive the server callback. Note TypeScript did not
//     flag the now-unreachable handler call.
//
// WHAT THE SUITE DOES STILL PROVE, stated so this block is not read as "the tests are worthless":
// deleting the handler's refusal response entirely DOES die on the named cell
// `unauthenticated verdict becomes a 401`. The handler-prefix cells are sound FOR CODE THEY REACH.
// Every survivor above either walks around that prefix or exploits response ordering the fakes do
// not model — none of them shows a covered assertion to be wrong.
//
// THE ONE DURABLE FIX, deliberately NOT attempted here: drive a real HTTP request through the
// actual server wiring (or refactor the server/handler composition into a directly executable
// factory the test invokes end-to-end). A cheaper substitute that cannot drive the real running
// server would be a fixture wearing an integration test's name — the same defect shape as (3).
// Tracked as a follow-up, not as a blocker on this change.
