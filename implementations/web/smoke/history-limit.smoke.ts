/**
 * THE LIMIT IS ONE PARAMETER, SO IT GETS ONE PARSE, AND THE SINGLE-CHANNEL READ GETS THE SAME BOUND
 * AS ITS SIBLINGS.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE THIS EXISTED (Cotal #699), against a local nats-server with 12 channels
 * of 60 chat plus 40 DMs, read by the SHIPPED `web` process across a delaying proxy:
 *
 *   ?limit=abc       Number("abc") is NaN. Every comparison against NaN is false, so core's
 *                    `limit <= 0` guard never fires and the widening search's two exits can never
 *                    be true: `page.length >= NaN` is false forever, and `start === 1` compares
 *                    against a NaN start. NO ANSWER after 30s. Worse, the ABANDONED request kept
 *                    running: 0% of a core idle, 58% with the request in flight, and still 53%,
 *                    51% and 46% at five, fifteen and twenty seconds AFTER the caller aborted,
 *                    while the process kept serving every other route, so nothing announced it.
 *                    One GET burns half a core until the dashboard is restarted.
 *   ?limit=Infinity  passes the same guard from the other end, `start` collapses to 1, and
 *                    slice(-Infinity) is the whole array: 31971B, the channel's entire retained
 *                    history, identical to asking for all of it. `1e999` is the same value.
 *   ?limit=2.5       silently truncated to 2, so the page read was not the page requested.
 *   /api/channels/<n>/history took 11360ms on a link where /api/dms already refused at 8005ms,
 *                    because the aggregate routes were given a per-request deadline and this one,
 *                    a single read, was not. The console page re-reads it every poll.
 *
 * WHAT DID **NOT** REPRODUCE, recorded so nobody re-litigates it. #699 argued `?limit=0` returns
 * everything via `slice(-0)`. Measured: `?limit=0` returns 0 entries on all three routes, and so
 * does `?limit=-3`, because `streamHistory` opens with `if (limit <= 0) return []` and the slice the
 * issue reasons about is never reached with a full array. The issue's CONCLUSION (a malformed limit
 * yields an unbounded response) is real; its trigger value was wrong. §1.9 pins 0 at zero so a
 * future change cannot quietly make the original claim true.
 *
 * THE CELLS RUN AGAINST A REAL BROKER AND THE REAL SERVER. A hand-built request object would prove
 * a helper returns what it returns; it would not prove the routes agree, which is the whole defect.
 *
 * Needs nats-server on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:web-history-limit
