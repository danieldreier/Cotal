/** Run the SHIPPED `web` command entry point in a child process, so a smoke can read the
 *  dashboard's real HTTP surface rather than a copy of it.
 *
 *  `implementations/web/src/index.ts` registers this exact function as the `web` command's `run`,
 *  and `web()` serves until it is signalled, so it cannot be awaited in-process by a suite that has
 *  assertions after it. Argument parsing here is the flag subset the suite passes; anything else is
 *  ignored rather than guessed at.
 *
 *  Not shipped and not imported by shipped code: this file lives under `smoke/`. */
