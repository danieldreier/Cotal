/**
 * A CHANNEL NAME THE WIRE WOULD REWRITE ADDRESSES A DIFFERENT CHANNEL THAN IT NAMES.
 *
 * The dashboard takes a channel name from the caller in two places: the path segment of
 * `/api/channels/<name>/history`, and the JSON body of `POST /api/channel/delete`. Both handed it
 * straight to core, and core builds a channel's subject through `token()`, which REWRITES anything
 * outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` to `_` instead of refusing it. So two different names are one channel on
 * the wire, while the dashboard answers with whichever one the caller typed.
 *
 * MEASURED against the shipped routes on a local broker before this existed, with one message
 * seeded on `abc_`:
 *
 *   GET /api/channels/abc%E2%80%AE/history   200, and it returned `abc_`'s message.
 *   POST /api/channel/delete {"channel":"abc<U+202E>"}
 *                                            200 {"ok":true,"channel":"abc<U+202E>","purged":1},
 *                                            and `abc_`'s message was gone.
 *
 * That second one is a destructive route on a dashboard holding a god-view cred: a caller names one
 * channel and a different channel is purged, and the answer reports the name that was typed. Making
 * that answer render readably (Cotal #711, the sibling suite here) would have made the lie legible
 * without removing it, which is why the name is refused instead.
 *
 * Core already owns the rule and wrote it for the same aliasing gap on the ACL side:
 * `assertValidChannel` rejects, fail-loud, anything `token()` would silently rewrite. The dashboard
 * simply never asked it. The refusal is a 400 built through the same quoter as every other refusal,
 * so the name it names is readable.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM: the rewrite in `token()` is unchanged and is not this suite's subject.
 * Only the two caller-facing boundaries are closed here.
 *
 * Needs nats-server on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:web-channel-alias
