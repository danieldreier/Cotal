/**
 * A REFUSAL THAT NAMES THE CALLER'S VALUE HAS TO RENDER IT, AND `JSON.stringify` DOES NOT DO THAT
 * JOB.
 *
 * The dashboard echoes a caller-supplied value in two places: the 400 body, and the `console.error`
 * line the request frame writes when it refuses. Both were built with `JSON.stringify`, which was
 * doing double duty. It is a JSON serializer and it is good at that; it is not a renderer for a
 * human reading a terminal and has never claimed to be.
 *
 * MEASURED BEFORE THIS EXISTED (Cotal #711), against the SHIPPED `web()` entry over a local broker,
 * driving `/api/activity?limit=` with each codepoint percent-encoded and reading the answer as
 * BYTES. Reading it through `res.json()` would decode the very thing under test and hand the input
 * back whatever the server wrote, so every case would have looked identical.
 *
 *   ESC 0x1b, LF 0x0a   escaped, both places. `JSON.stringify` closes all of C0, so the
 *                       terminal-escape-sequence class was already shut before this change.
 *   DEL U+007F          RAW in the body AND raw in the operator's line.
 *   U+0085, U+009B      RAW. The C1 controls, which the issue did not name.
 *   U+202E              RAW. Right-to-left override: it does not vanish, it REVERSES the rendering
 *                       of the text after it, which is the "what the operator reads is not what the
 *                       caller sent" defect in its strongest form.
 *   U+2028, U+2029      RAW.
 *
 * So the issue's list of three was a sample, not the class. The class is: codepoints that render as
 * nothing, render as something else, or reorder their neighbours, and that `JSON.stringify` passes
 * through. The fix escapes that class at the QUOTING site rather than at the two exits, because the
 * untrusted thing is the value and the message is derived from it.
 *
 * THE FIRST VERSION OF THE FIX WROTE THAT CLASS AS A HAND LIST AND THE LIST WAS WRONG. Review
 * measured U+061C, U+2060, the variation selectors and the tag characters arriving raw through the
 * same route: every one of them is the thing the list said it closed. THE SECOND VERSION NAMED ONE
 * PROPERTY AND THAT PROPERTY WAS TOO NARROW: review then measured U+FFF9 to U+FFFB, the interlinear
 * annotation controls, arriving raw, because they are format characters that are not
 * default-ignorable. They mark a span as base text plus its gloss, so a reader whose terminal does
 * not implement them sees two runs of text concatenated into a sentence nobody sent.
 *
 * The class is now the Unicode properties `Default_Ignorable_Code_Point` and `gc=Cf`, plus DEL, the
 * C1 controls and U+2028/U+2029, which no property covers. `Bidi_Control` is not named because all
 * twelve of its members are already default-ignorable, and cell 0.10 pins that by hand so a Unicode
 * version that separated them reds rather than silently narrowing the class. The codepoints below
 * are named individually anyway, because a failure should say WHICH one. Naming is not proof that
 * the literal encodes the union it claims, so cell 0.12 sweeps every codepoint from 0 to 0x10FFFF
 * and compares what the quoter did against that union.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ESCAPED, and section 0 proves it: ordinary text, non-ASCII LETTERS, and
 * COMBINING MARKS (0.13 to 0.15, added after review found U+0338 raw and asked whether it belonged:
 * it makes a visible mark on a visible base, and its property is the one carrying the accent in a
 * name written in NFD).
 * A quoter that escaped every byte over 0x7f would render a refusal about an accented channel name
 * unreadable, which is the same defect pointed the other way.
 *
 * A BOUND THAT IS NOT THIS CHANGE'S, recorded so it is not read as one: a query value long
 * enough to push the request line past Node's header limit is refused by the PARSER with a
 * 431 and a non-JSON body, before any route runs. Measured at 4000 repetitions of U+2028.
 * That is the same bound any long URL meets and it predates this file.
 *
 * Needs nats-server on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:web-echo-escaping
