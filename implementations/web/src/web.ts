 *  the looser phrase admits every combining mark, and the paragraph at the end of this comment is
 *  why escaping those would be this issue pointed the other way. The first version of this WAS a hand list, and review
 *  found it missing U+061C, U+2060, the variation selectors and the tag characters, every one of
 *  which is exactly the thing the list said it closed. A list is a claim about a set nobody
 *  maintains; the property IS the set, and it moves with the Unicode version the runtime carries.
 *
 *  Two properties, because neither contains the other and both name the same harm from a different
 *  side. `Default_Ignorable_Code_Point` is the renders-as-nothing family: the soft hyphen, the
 *  zero-width characters, the word joiner, the variation selectors, the tag characters and the BOM.
 *  `Cf` is the format family: characters with no glyph of their own that change how the text around
 *  them is read, which is where the interlinear annotation controls U+FFF9 to U+FFFB live. Review
 *  found those three arriving raw against a class that had only the first property, and they are the
 *  clearest case of the harm: they mark a span as base text plus its gloss, so a reader whose
 *  terminal does not implement them sees the two runs concatenated into a sentence nobody wrote.
 *  Measured, the second property adds 32 codepoints and not one of them is a letter or a digit.
 *
 *  `Bidi_Control` is deliberately absent: measured on this runtime, all twelve of its codepoints,
 *  U+061C and the isolates included, are already default-ignorable, so naming it would be a second
 *  name for one set. The suite pins those twelve by hand, so a Unicode version that separated them
 *  goes red rather than quietly leaving a reordering character raw.
 *
 *  What no property covers is DEL and the C1 controls, which are `Cc`, and U+2028/U+2029, which are
 *  line and paragraph separators, so those are named. C0 is absent because `JSON.stringify` already
 *  escapes all of it.
 *
 *  NOT IN THIS CLASS, and deliberately: a VISIBLE character that merely resembles another. A Cyrillic
 *  small a is a letter, it renders as itself, and escaping it would make a refusal about a name a
 *  human typed unreadable, which is this issue pointed the other way. Confusables are a different
 *  problem with a different answer, and quoting for a human to read is not it.
 *
 *  NOT IN THIS CLASS EITHER, and this one review reached by finding U+0338 COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS
 *  OVERLAY arriving raw and asking whether it belonged: a COMBINING MARK. It produces a visible
 *  mark on a visible base, and the property that carries it, `gc=Mn`, is the same one carrying the
 *  acute accent in a name written in NFD, the Devanagari vowel signs, the Arabic and Hebrew points
 *  and the Vietnamese tones. Measured on this runtime, marks are 2543 codepoints and only 263 of
 *  them are already in the class, so escaping them would take about 2280 codepoints of ordinary
 *  written language and render an accented name as its escapes. A mark CAN build a confusable
 *  (U+0338 over `=` renders as a not-equals sign, so a quoted `a=b` can display as `a` not-equals
 *  `b`), which is a real harm and the same one the paragraph above declines: it is unbounded, it
 *  needs no combining mark to exist, and its answer is normalization or confusable detection
 *  rather than making every script that writes with marks unreadable. The suite asserts both
 *  exclusions rather than only describing them. */

/** QUOTE A CALLER'S OWN VALUE SO AN OPERATOR CAN READ IT.
 *
 *  `JSON.stringify` was doing two jobs at every site below and only claims one of them. It builds
 *  valid JSON, and on the way it escapes every C0 control, so `ESC` arrives as the six characters
 *  `\u001b` and a newline as `\n`. It is not a renderer for humans and never said it was: DEL, the
 *  C1 range, `U+2028`/`U+2029`, the bidi controls and the zero-width characters are all valid JSON
 *  string content and pass through untouched.
 *
 *  MEASURED against the shipped `web()` entry before this existed, driving `/api/activity?limit=`
 *  with each codepoint percent-encoded and reading the answer as BYTES rather than through a JSON
 *  parse (a parse decodes the very thing under test and hands the input back whatever the server
 *  wrote). Six of eight arrived raw in BOTH the 400 body and the operator's stderr line: DEL,
 *  `U+0085`, `U+009B`, `U+202E`, `U+2028`, `U+2029`. `ESC` and `LF` came back escaped, which is
 *  what makes the other six a finding rather than a property of the harness.
 *
 *  The escape is emitted as `\uXXXX`, so the message stays valid JSON on the body path and reads as
 *  the codepoint it is on the terminal path. Applied where the value is QUOTED rather than where it
 *  is written out, because the untrusted thing is the value and the message is derived from it: a
 *  guard at the two exits fences those two exits, while a guard here travels with the sentence.
 *
 *  The loop below is per UTF-16 UNIT, not per codepoint: `u` hands the callback a whole codepoint,
 *  so an astral one (a tag character, a musical control) arrives as its surrogate pair and has to
 *  leave as two escapes. `\u1d173` is not a JSON escape, and a body carrying it would stop parsing
 *  for the caller who asked what was wrong with their request. */
