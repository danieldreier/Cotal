   *  that the key expired, or that anyone else took it. It may even have LANDED, with only the
   *  acknowledgement lost. Terminating on it kills a healthy manager and takes its agents with it.
   *
   *  So the renew failing is a question, not a verdict, and the verdict comes from RE-READING the key
   *  ({@link CotalEndpoint.readOwnManagerLease}, which separates "it is gone" from "I could not find
   *  out"). We fail closed on PROOF — the key is absent, or it is present and holds someone else — and
   *  otherwise keep serving, adopting whatever revision the broker actually has.
   *
   *  WHEN NO ANSWER IS AVAILABLE AT ALL, the bound is time, not attempts: past one whole TTL with no
   *  renew that LANDED, the key may have expired and been re-acquired, so this instance can no longer
   *  claim to hold it and fails closed on that ground, said plainly. A re-read answering "still yours,
   *  same revision" IS an answer and we keep serving on it, but it did not touch the key, so it buys
   *  no time — reading a key is not refreshing it. Inside the TTL the budget affords another
   *  renew-and-re-read pair ({@link MANAGER_LEASE_RENEW_MS}), which is what makes waiting safe.
   *
   *  FAILING CLOSED IS FOR THIS INSTANCE ONLY: stop serving + tear down OUR managed agents + exit, so a
   *  stalled instance can't keep double-processing under a key a same-id restart may re-acquire. Keyed
   *  per instance, so it NEVER frees or touches a sibling manager's key and NEVER freezes the space
   *  (security pin 6) — the sibling keeps serving. We do NOT re-acquire (a same-id restart may already

   *  closed by any planned slice and must not be described as temporary.
   *
   *  THE RESIDUAL, STACKED:
   *   1. SIBLING-MINT INJECTION. A §13.1 barrier's revoke/evict loop closes only over the family
   *      SNAPSHOT IT ENUMERATED, so a sibling mint that observes the gate and stages a ledger row
   *      WITHOUT the observe/open/commit fence can be staged and released AFTER that enumerate and
   *      never be revoked. This layer is closed exactly where BOTH sibling mint sites
   *      ({@link mintAndStageGoalWriter}, {@link mintAndStageSessionLedger}) route their stage
   *      through `commitSiblingIssuance` (the revision-pinned CAS that makes a losing mint release
   *      nothing), and open exactly where they do not — state the mechanism, never the branch.
   *   2. THE BARRIER WINDOW. A gate FREEZE neither kills this connection nor advances the epoch,
   *      and this belt compares `processEpoch` alone, so it still PASSES from barrier start until
   *      the reopen. A ledger revoke marks a row; it does not re-check a live JWT mid-publish. The
   *      durable kill is the CLUSTER-VERIFIED EVICTION, so a deposed manager can INITIATE new
   *      terminal publishes from barrier start until eviction is verified — not merely finish bytes
   *      already on the wire. Successor EXISTENCE and corpse DEATH are different phases, so the
   *      barrier's ordering licenses no conclusion about when the corpse stops being able to write.
   *   3. OPEN MESH. No credential family exists, so the revoke/evict loop is vacuous and this belt
   *      is COOPERATIVE only: a non-conformant process simply does not run it.
   *  The named follow-up that would close 2 and 3 is the gate-linearized commit (routing the
   *  terminal through the issuance gate's own CAS), deliberately deferred as substrate territory.
