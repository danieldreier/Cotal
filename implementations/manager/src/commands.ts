 * RECORD THIS PROCESS as the running manager, and un-record it on a clean exit.
 *
 * The daemon writes its OWN pid because it is the only participant that knows it. Until now the
 * record was written by whoever SPAWNED a manager (`cotal up`'s detached re-exec), so every other
 * route to a running manager — a container entrypoint, cron, an operator typing `cotal supervise` —
 * left `.cotal/manager.pid` untouched. On a box where a supervisor is respawned by anything but the
 * CLI, the file then holds the pid of a manager that died some time ago while the live one runs
 * unlisted, and every reader of that file is answering about a process that no longer exists.
 *
 * The returned release is pid-CHECKED. A manager that exits must not delete a record that already
 * belongs to its successor (a fast restart writes the new pid before the old process finishes
 * unwinding), so the record is removed only while it still names this process — the same rule the
 * rest of the pidfile contract keeps: never delete a record you cannot prove is yours.
 *
 * A folder with no `.cotal/` is not a workspace and gets no record: creating one here would plant a
 * stray workspace root wherever a manager happened to be started.
