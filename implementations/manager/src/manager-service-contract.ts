/**
 * The manager's v0.4 SERVICE CONTRACT (control-surface P2 item 1): the §13.7 cluster document +
 * compiled command contracts that let the manager register as an ordinary `service` endpoint and
 * serve typed commands on the `ep.*` rails, dual-served beside its bespoke
 * `ctl.<tier>.<owner>.<actor>` control subjects until 1d deletes those.
 *
 * This module is PURE DATA + schema (no broker, no barrier, no wire I/O): the content-addressed
 * cluster document (the authority for every command's served shape) and the provenance-branded
 * `compileContract` pairs each `EpCommandDef` must carry. The registration/serve WIRING lives in
 * the manager (`registerManagerService`).
 *
 * REVISION 2 (slice 1b): the FULL op fan-out. Every served `ctl` op maps to a typed command; the
 * v0.3 op names map onto the Appendix-B caller vocabulary where one exists (`start` -> `spawn`;
 * the named `stop` -> `despawn` — on the v0.3 surface a named stop and a despawn are the same
 * terminal; the self no-name `stop` -> `stop` with authz-mode `self`; the per-agent `status`
 * read -> `inspect`, distinct from the 1a manager-level `status`). Targeting: `despawn`/`attach`
 * ride owner mode (the target block names the agent's principal + lifecycle uid; the fresh
 * resolver checks currency). `child` mode is DELIBERATELY NOT DECLARED anywhere — the panel's 1b
 * gate requires a DURABLE spawner record before child mode exists, so it fails closed by absence
 * until that record lands; own-child narrowing on despawn/attach meanwhile rides the SAME
 * `authorizeNamedControl` policy the ctl privileged tier runs (in-memory spawner, identical
 * source both doors). `ledger` mode is likewise absent (admin != ledger in static mode): every
 * admin-class command is untargeted + capability-gated — the broker grant (who holds the
 * request-publish row) stays the load-bearing tier boundary, exactly as the ctl cred layer is
 * today; the 1c migration table names who mints which capability.
 *
 * Capability labels (describe/grant vocabulary, one per tier class):
 *   manager.read     status / ps / inspect / models / list-personas / show-persona
 *   manager.spawn    spawn                                 (privileged-grade creation)
 *   manager.lifecycle despawn / attach / input             (owner-mode terminal/interactive)
 *   manager.self     stop                                  (self-mode halt; baseline)
 *   manager.persona  definePersona                         (privileged-grade; ownership-checked)
 *   manager.admin    purge / launch / resume family        (operator instruments only)
