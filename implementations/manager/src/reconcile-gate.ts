/**
 * GUARDED RECONCILIATION of an endpoint issuance gate left FROZEN by a crashed re-registration
 * (Cotal #391; SPEC 13.1 "the gate is left frozen for reconciliation").
 *
 * THE STATE THIS REPAIRS, and the only one it accepts: a manager restart was killed between the
 * barrier's freeze and the successor's completion. The gate is `frozen` under a `registration` op
 * whose holder no longer exists, so the freeze token's owner can never resume. Fail-closed is
 * correct and stays correct — but in THAT state the freeze protects nothing while blocking every
 * restart, and before this the operator's only exits were hand-driving internals or discarding
 * state.
 *
 * The repair itself is not new: it is the SHIPPED composition (`endpointRegistrationBarrier` +
 * a verified evictor), driven in the §13.1 order, with no raw writes. What is new is the GUARD in
 * front of it, which is the whole point of the command:
 *
 *   1. VERIFY THE HOLDER IS GONE, AFFIRMATIVELY. Not "the holder did not answer", not "a timeout
 *      elapsed" — a COMPLETE, single-server-proven CONNZ sweep that PROVES no connection attributes
 *      to the freeze-holder. Absence of evidence is `unknown`, and `unknown` REFUSES.
 *   2. LOG WHAT WAS FOUND, before mutating anything.
 *   3. REFUSE LOUD, NAMING WHICH CONDITION FAILED — an operator staring at a wedged mesh needs to
 *      know whether the holder is alive, whether liveness could not be established, or whether the
 *      gate simply is not in the state this repairs. "It refused" is not actionable.
 *
 * The probe sits ON TOP OF the barrier's own fail-closed eviction, never in place of it: BOTH must
 * pass. There is deliberately NO force flag and no path that discards gate state — a recovery path
 * whose failure mode is killing a live manager does not get an override.
