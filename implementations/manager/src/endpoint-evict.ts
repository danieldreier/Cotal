/**
 * The manager's VERIFIED-EVICTION seam for its own endpoint-registration barrier (SPEC 13.1, P2
 * item 3, slice 3a). A restart re-registers the SAME logical instanceId with an ADVANCED epoch, and
 * §13.1 requires the SUPERSEDED serve family to die BEFORE the new authority is visible — so the
 * registration barrier's PHASE 2 must VERIFY-EVICT the predecessor's serve principal. The `$SYS`
 * scan → KICK → verify capability lives with the DELIVERY DAEMON (co-located with the broker), never
 * in this process (the manager holds the DATA signing seed; the D5 rail-split keeps `$SYS` material
 * out of any seed-holder). This reaches the daemon over the privileged `ctl.delivery-admin` rail
 * with a per-call SCOPED `endpoint-evictor` credential (pub the delivery-admin subject + reply +
 * `$JS.API.INFO`, nothing else — narrower than the `supervisor` profile auth's barrier-evict reuses).
 *
 * NO-ORACLE = LOUD (no-fallbacks): if the daemon is unreachable the evictor THROWS an error NAMING
 * THE CURE, so the barrier's PHASE-2 failure carries it and the gate stays frozen for reconciliation
 * — a crash-restart on an auth mesh NEVER skips eviction. A reachable daemon that reports the
 * principal still connected (or a garbled/contradictory result) returns `false` (not verified),
 * which the barrier also treats as fail-closed. Verified-gone is conclusive only as (scan complete,
 * none remain).
