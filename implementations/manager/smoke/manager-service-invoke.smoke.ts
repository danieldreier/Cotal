/**
 * GENERIC DESCRIBE/INVOKE smoke (control-surface P2 item 1, item 5 substrate) — the caller path
 * every migrated control consumer rides, proven against a REAL Manager + JWT broker WITHOUT the
 * caller importing the manager's contract module. The whole point: a caller learns the manager's
 * command surface at runtime (describe → fetch the registered contracts from the §13.7 store →
 * recompile the digest-matching validators) and invokes by name.
 *
 * Deliberately imports the endpoint NAME and the shipped cluster document's surface, never
 * MANAGER_CONTRACTS. If this compiled and ran while secretly depending on the hand-written
 * contracts, that would defeat the test; it does not. The command-count pin is derived from
 * `managerShippedSurface()`, not restated, so a later served command cannot silently desync.
 *
 *  1. resolveService(manager) describes + fetches + recompiles the FULL visible surface (the
 *     shipped cluster document's command set), each with a recompiled input/output contract whose
 *     closureDigest MATCHES the registered declaration.
 *  2. invoke "status" (untargeted, void) returns the typed ManagerStatus.
 *  3. invoke "spawn" (the 16-field launch) boots a REAL agent; the recompiled input contract
 *     gates a bad field pre-publish (the caller's own closed schema, fetched not hand-written).
 *  4. invoke targeted "despawn" (owner mode) tears the agent down; a targeted command invoked
 *     without a target, and an untargeted one WITH a target, both refuse at the generic layer.
 *  5. a command OUTSIDE the caller's describe VIEW is not in the resolved surface (not-found).
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:manager-service-invoke   (needs nats-server + node on PATH; boots its own broker)
