/**
 * A MANAGER THAT MAY NO LONGER SERVE MUST NOT DESTROY THE AGENTS IT WAS SERVING.
 * Run: pnpm smoke:detach-not-teardown   (no broker; in-process manager with a fake runtime)
 *
 * THIS IS A REPRODUCTION FIRST. Written against the shipped behaviour and observed RED on it.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `failClosedOnLeaseLoss` is the path a manager takes when it can no longer prove it
 * holds its liveness lease. Stopping SERVING is the correct conclusion there and is not in question.
 * Destroying the CHILDREN is a separate act that the same branch performs: it calls
 * `teardownManagedAgents()`, which hard-stops every managed child and then deprovisions its
 * credential, its durables and its broker footprint. A supervisor that has merely lost the argument
 * about who serves the space has learned nothing about whether its agents should die.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS NOT THEORETICAL. `/home/david/mesh-logs/manager.log` records four occurrences on the
 * live space "main" of "could not renew its liveness lease (timeout) - the key is still ours at
 * revision N ... so this instance keeps serving". Each of those survived only because the re-read
 * answered. The neighbouring branch, taken when the re-read ALSO times out past the lease TTL, ends
 * in this teardown; the same log in a probe space shows it firing. On the day this suite was
 * written that supervisor was holding twelve seats.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE GRADES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It grades the CALL SITE (`failClosedOnLeaseLoss`
 * itself, with only `process.exit` neutralised) and not merely a helper reached from it, because a
 * detach helper that nothing calls is exactly the shape this defect would survive. It does NOT
 * claim a pty child survives the manager's exit: measured separately, a `@lydell/node-pty` child
 * dies when its spawning process exits (positive control: the same child stays alive while the
 * parent lives), and no manager-side policy changes that. What this fixes is the manager
 * DELIBERATELY killing and deprovisioning; making the child outlive the process is the seat-host
 * slice, and this suite must not be read as proving it.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS NOT OPTIONAL. "stops === 0" is also what a broken counter reports, and a
 * suite whose instrument never fires reads identically to a suite whose subject behaved. Cell 0
 * drives the ORDINARY shutdown path, which is deliberately left destructive, and requires the same
 * counter to reach 1. Without that, every zero below is unearned.
 *
 * ── NAMED RESIDUALS (adversarial review, 2026-08-24) ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two properties this change does NOT establish. Both are answered by the adoption slice, and both
 * are named here rather than left for a reader to discover, because detaching without adoption is
 * a deliberate intermediate state and its edges should be legible from the suite that created it.
 *
 * R1 — A ~10s PARTITION CAN DETACH A HEALTHY MANAGER. The lease TTL is the whole budget, so a brief
 * broker partition still ends a manager that was working perfectly. What it leaves is now
 * crash-shaped rather than destroyed, which is strictly better, but nothing ADOPTS it: there is no
 * auto-adopt, and the slots stay instance-owned until a successor terminalizes them. Detach turns a
 * catastrophe into a recoverable state; it does not perform the recovery. The explicit acknowledged
 * handover control op plus `Runtime.adopt` is the designed answer, and R1 is its acceptance case.
 *
 * R2 — A `--resume-attempt` SUCCESSOR DOES NOT CHECK HOST-SESSION OCCUPANCY. After an active-state
 * detach, a successor started with `--resume-attempt` reaches `launchPreparedResume` and
 * `runtime.spawn` without asking whether a detached child is still occupying that host session. On
 * a runtime whose children genuinely outlive their manager (tmux/herdr/cmux) that is a second live
 * process for one identity. It requires a coordinator to replay an inventory that this change's own
 * recovery story says should be adopted instead, so it is misuse rather than a path the manager
 * offers — but "only reachable by misuse" is not a fence, and it earns a named cell in the adoption
 * slice rather than a sentence here.
