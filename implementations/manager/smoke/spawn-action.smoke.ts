/**
 * SPAWN-AS-ACTION smoke (control-surface P2 item 2) — proves the functional musts of "spawn
 * becomes an action" against a REAL open-mesh Manager + broker + REAL agent processes. The
 * caller-scoped progress-read grant is 2b work, so the FUNCTIONAL musts run on an OPEN mesh where a
 * bare connection observes the epe progress subtree freely; the M7 writer-separation + pin-2/3 ACL
 * musts run on the AUTH leg (broker-enforced), added with the must-5 auth wiring.
 *
 *   M1 ACCEPT SHAPE    spawn replies the acceptance floor {name, owner, actor, uid, goalId,
 *                      fingerprint, readinessDeadlineMs, executor{lifecycleUid, epoch}} — NOT the
 *                      ~30s blocking reply —
 *                      goalId === the request id (Q3); executor.lifecycleUid is the manager
 *                      incarnation; the payload carries no secret material (pin 7).
 *   M2 PROGRESS ORDER  the goal's progress rides the caller-scoped epe subtree: handoff -> launched
 *                      -> presence, in order; the terminal rides a final `phase:"terminal"` event.
 *   M3 THREE TERMINALS presence join -> succeeded (carrying the spawned identity); process exit ->
 *                      failed; the readiness window elapsing -> uncertain (bounded, never success).
 *   M6 SAME-ALIAS      a hard-pinned (--name/identity override) collision with a live incarnation
 *                      REFUSES at accept (no bind, no process); a persona-derived base name numbers.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:manager-spawn-action   (needs nats-server + node on PATH; boots its own broker)
