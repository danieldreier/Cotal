/**
 * SECRET-STORE SEAM smoke (control-surface v0.4, Lane B finding 2) — the manager has ONE
 * `SecretStore` (`this.secrets`, the injected `ManagerOptions.secretStore` or the workspace FS
 * default). Every credential the manager reads, writes, or deletes MUST go through it.
 *
 * Four sites bypassed the seam and built their own `workspaceSecretStore(this.workspaceRoot)`:
 * the managed-cred renewal scan, the static-resume seed recovery, the retirement cleanup, and the
 * managed-cred re-sign. On a workstation the two stores happen to be the same object graph, so
 * nothing looks wrong; against ANY injected store (a hosted KMS/Vault adapter, which is the whole
 * point of the seam) the manager renews from a store it never reads, and a retired agent's
 * credential is never removed from the configured backend.
 *
 * The probe is a RECORDING PROXY over the real FS store, injected as `secretStore`. Behaviour is
 * byte-identical to today's default — the only observable is WHICH accesses arrived at the seam.
 * The lifecycle below is real: a real broker, real auth, a real spawn, the real renewal pass, the
 * real re-sign, the real retirement. Each check asserts the seam saw the access AND that the
 * access really happened (the file moved / the row landed), so a check can never pass by the
 * access simply not occurring.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:secret-store-seam   (needs nats-server + node on PATH; boots its own broker)
