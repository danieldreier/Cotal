/**
 * THE EVENT GRANT IS KEYED ON THE PRINCIPAL, AND THIS SUITE IS WHERE THAT IS ENFORCED RATHER THAN
 * DOCUMENTED.
 *
 * An agent's AG-UI event plane lands on a channel derived from the principal it was ALLOCATED, never
 * from its display name. The difference is not cosmetic. A display name is UI convenience: this mesh
 * permits two live agents to carry one, and the manager itself auto-numbers collisions, so a
 * name-keyed channel fuses two principals onto one subject and, in auth mode, authorizes both onto it
 * from a value that identifies neither. The cells below decode the JWT the manager actually minted
 * and check the granted subject against the principal, not against a substring.
 *
 * BROKER-BACKED, because the property lives in the credential rather than in a variable. Each spawn
 * provisions through a short-lived ephemeral provisioner connection, so `startAgent` connects for
 * real before minting; we boot our own JWT-auth nats-server, let the real spawn path run end to end,
 * then read the publish ACL out of the written creds.
 *
 * WHAT THE RESUME HALF PROVES. A resume ADOPTS the credential the spawn wrote rather than minting a
 * second one, so the question a restart raises is not "is the grant re-derived correctly" but "does
 * the record carry it forward at all", and there are two ways to lose it: the inventory can drop the
 * channel from `allowPublish`, or it can drop the ARMING flag and bring the session back holding a
 * grant it will never publish to. Cells below assert both halves survive the round trip.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO CLAIM THAT A RESUME REFUSES WHEN THE INVENTORY'S `allowPublish` NO
 * LONGER MATCHES THE ADOPTED AUTHORITY'S. That is true in USER mode and was never true in static,
 * where the retained-authority check pins the credential's path, its identity and the broker's
 * acceptance of it and says nothing about its ACL. A security review found the consequence: the
 * managed row is re-armed straight from the inventory, `renewManagedStaticCred` re-mints the JWT out
 * of that row at half TTL, and a foreign concrete event channel written into an admin-supplied
 * document therefore became a minted read on another agent's tool inputs and outputs one renewal
 * later. Section 7 is the reproduction, and it exists because a comment asserting a refusal that
 * does not happen is worse than no comment: it is the reason nobody looked.
 *
 * Run with: pnpm smoke:events-grant

  // 4 — THE OWN-CHANNEL RULE. A spawn may be granted the event plane of the agent it is CREATING,
  // and no other.
  //
  // Why this rule exists where it does. `subscribe`, `allowSubscribe` and `allowPublish` are
  // caller-supplied on every spawn door. On a per-user-auth mesh the ledger's spawner envelope
  // already refuses a delegation wider than the spawner's own grant. On a STATIC mesh there is no
  // ledger, so nothing attenuates a caller-supplied ACL at all, and a caller that may spawn may
  // mint its child a read on any subject it names. An event channel is the subject worth naming:
  // it carries the session's tool inputs and outputs verbatim.
  //
  // The rule does not ask WHO the caller is. On a static mesh that question has no answer worth
  // acting on: the reach a static caller holds is true by construction of everyone who can reach
  // the handler. It asks whether the event channel names the agent being created, which the
  // manager knows because it has just allocated the principal.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE EXEMPTION HALF IS NOT REACHABLE AT THIS DOOR, and saying so precisely is the point. In
  // static mode the SPAWN seam's allocated actor is a freshly minted nkey (`newIdentity()` inside
  // the accept body), so no caller can name the child's own channel before it exists and every
  // concrete event channel a static caller supplies to a SPAWN is by construction foreign. The
  // exemption is reachable at the RESUME door even here, because a document names the identity it
  // is re-arming: sections 7 and 8 each carry a clean control that resumes an inventory holding the
  // armed agent's OWN channel and asserts this rule does not refuse it. It is reachable at the
  // SPAWN door in USER mode, where the allocated actor IS the requested name, and it is
  // load-bearing there: without it a legitimate spawn that carries its child's own channel forward
  // would be refused. That door is graded against a real user-mode mesh in
  // `implementations/auth/smoke/user-spawn.smoke.ts`, whose event cells are refusals and the
  // wildcard pass-through; the admitted-own-channel spawn is what this suite cannot see.

  // `--allow-subscribe` ONLY for the agent profile, and the observer arm of `permissionsFor`
  // hardcodes `chat.>`. So an operator following the refusal to the letter got a reader of the
  // WHOLE chat plane while believing they had scoped one channel, which is the opposite of what
  // the sentence around it promises. A live mint against a real broker is what found it.
  //
  // This cell is what keeps the sentence and the mint from drifting apart again: it PARSES the
  // profile out of the manager's own refusal string rather than hardcoding one, so rewording the
  // remedy back to a profile that ignores the flag reddens HERE instead of in a terminal.
  {

    // ungraded: a refusal printing `--allow-subscribe events.wrong.wrong` would keep every cell
