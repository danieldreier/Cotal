/**
 * Lifecycle e2e (#159 Part B) — the REAL end-to-end the fake-runtime preflight can't reach: a real
 * JWT-auth broker + a real Manager + real agent PROCESSES (e2e-stub.mjs) that join presence, driving the
 * actual production paths and INSPECTING the real broker footprint.
 *
 *   1. STARTED via real presence — startAgent resolves ok only once the agent's assigned id is live in
 *      presence; its footprint (dm_local-/dlv_local- durables + ACL row + creds file) exists on the broker/disk.
 *   2. DEPROVISION on despawn — a real despawn tears that footprint down: durables gone, ACL row gone,
 *      creds file gone.
 *   3. FAILED launch — an agent whose process exits on arrival is reported {ok:false} "exited on launch",
 *      and its just-minted footprint is rolled back (deprovisioned), not orphaned.
 *  3b. UNCERTAIN — a process that runs but never joins presence is reported {ok:false} "uncertain" and is
 *      KEPT (not deprovisioned — it may still be booting), distinct from both started and failed.
 *  3c. FAIL BEFORE PRESENCE — a launch missing the launcher uid, or lying a different one while
 *      consuming, dies with NO roster ghost (SPEC 13.1 fail-before-presence).
 *   4. SHUTDOWN teardown — Manager.stop() deprovisions every still-managed agent's footprint.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:lifecycle-e2e   (needs nats-server + node on PATH)
