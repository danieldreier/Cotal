/**
 * CLI `--on <instanceId>` REACHES THE MINT: the end-to-end arm `instrument-instance-pin` names as
 * its own coverage boundary and deliberately does not cover.
 *
 * That suite proves the GRANT SHAPING: given a pinned capability, the rows are exact and the live
 * instance rail answers. It states, verbatim, what it cannot prove: "It does NOT prove the CLI
 * actually threads `--on` down to the mint: `agents.ts`/`spawn.ts` → `resolveControlTarget` →
 * `connectOrExit` is covered by typecheck and by the golden flag inventory, not by an executing
 * test. A defect that dropped the argument anywhere along that chain would leave this suite green."
 *
 * THAT DEFECT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. It shipped. Measured on a 0.17.0 install against a live
 * two-manager space (2026-08-15): `cotal ps --on <full-id>` returned `no describe reply from
 * manager within 10000ms` for BOTH live instances, while an untargeted `describe` answered from
 * either in well under a second, a 10s deadline against a 115ms RTT. In that build
 * `cli/dist/lib/control.js` pinned the describe SUBJECT (`resolveService(…, { instanceId })`) while
 * calling `connectOrExit(withSpace, profile)` with two arguments, and `workspace/dist/connect.js`
 * declared `connectOrExit(flags, role)`: the third parameter did not exist, and
 * `instancePinnedInstrumentCapabilities` was absent from the entire install. The CLI addressed a
 * rail its own credential was never granted. The broker refused the publish, the client surfaced
 * nothing, and the caller ate the full deadline.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS WORTH A GATED SUITE. The failure is INVISIBLE at every layer that had a test. The
 * subject was right; the subscription was right; the grant emitter was right; only the argument
 * was missing, and a missing argument produces no error, just silence that renders as a timeout,
 * i.e. exactly the shape of "that manager isn't there". Typecheck cannot catch it (the parameter is
 * optional by design, so dropping it type-checks), and a flag inventory cannot (the flag IS parsed
 * and IS forwarded, just not all the way). Only running the real binary catches it.
 *
 * The consequence is not cosmetic. With `--on` dead, every lifecycle call falls back to the
 * unpinned class queue, where describe and invoke are separate trips; in a multi-manager space one
 * instance wins the describe and another wins the invoke, so an effect lands on one manager while
 * the caller is told it failed (SPEC 13.2). Pinning is the ONLY escape from that split, which makes
 * "the flag reaches the pin" a load-bearing claim, not a nicety.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE GRADES. The REAL binary, as a subprocess, against a REAL two-manager mesh. No
 * capability is constructed here and nothing is minted by hand; that is the whole point. If any
 * link in CLI → resolveControlTarget → connectOrExit → mint drops the instance, cell 3 goes red.
 *
 * COVERAGE BOUNDARY of THIS suite, stated so it is not over-read in turn. The chain splits in two
 * and the cells cover it in two pieces, deliberately:
 *   • the SHARED tail (`resolveControlTarget` → `connectOrExit` → mint) is graded ONCE, by cell 3,
 *     which is the only cell that completes a real pinned call end to end;
 *   • the PER-COMMAND heads are graded by cells 4 and 5: `ps`, `spawn --detach`, `stop`, `attach`
 *     each forward `--on` at their own call site, and each is checked separately because dropping
 *     any one of them type-checks and leaves the others green.
 * Read together they cover the whole path; neither covers it alone. An earlier draft claimed the
 * lifecycle commands were covered "transitively" by the `ps` cells; they were not, and that
 * over-read is the same one that let the original defect ship.
 *
 * What is still NOT graded here: cells 4 and 5 prove the pin ROUTES (an absent instance gets the
 * broker-confirmed no-responder result rather than falling through), not that a pinned
 * `spawn`/`stop`/`attach` completes against a real
 * instance; those mutate, and a live-mutation cell is a different fixture. And this suite does not
 * grade the class-queue split itself (SPEC 13.2 behaviour, not this seam).
 *
 * Mutation-proof target `cli-on-mint`: drop the instance from the mint (in
 * `packages/workspace/src/connect.ts`, force `pinned` to `undefined`) and cell 3's
 * "a pinned ps is answered by the instance it names" goes red.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:cli-on-instance   (build first; this drives bin/cotal.ts, which imports dist)
