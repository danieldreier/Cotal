/**
 * Start model-override + harness-preflight smoke — proves the two manager fixes end to end without
 * a broker or a real harness launch. No NATS, no test runner — run with: pnpm smoke:start-model
 *
 * The Manager constructor opens no network (that happens in start()), so we drive the real
 * `startAgent` spawn path directly, injecting a fake runtime + a minimal `ep` stub so the
 * success branch never launches a child or needs a live mesh. Covers:
 *   1. Preflight REJECT — a connector whose `requires` binary is off PATH fails before any
 *      credential/side effect, with a stable, PATH-content-independent error.
 *   2. Model THREADING — `--model` rides StartAgentOpts → buildLaunch's LaunchOpts verbatim.
 *   3. Model PRECEDENCE — across the three real connectors: flag > agent-file `model:`, the flag
 *      applies with no agent file, and the file is the fallback (the actual bug the fix closes).
 *   4. ACL THREADING — the resolved read/post set rides StartAgentOpts → LaunchOpts and each
 *      connector forwards it as COTAL_SUBSCRIBE / COTAL_ALLOW_*. Guards the bug where creds were
 *      minted from the policy but it never reached the connector, so a manifest-spawned agent (whose
 *      materialized persona has no access frontmatter) fell back to ["general"] and joined nothing.
 *   5. RESUME (issue #23) — claude buildLaunch emits `--resume <id> --fork-session` (never one
 *      without the other, hostile id stays one argv token, coexists with the persona append);
 *      opencode + hermes THROW; and `resume` threads StartAgentOpts → LaunchOpts verbatim.
 *   6. RESUME CAPABILITY PREFLIGHT (issue #159 Part A) — a resume request for a connector that doesn't
 *      declare `supportsResume` is rejected BEFORE any provisioning side effect (no mint, no
 *      buildLaunch), mirroring the harness preflight; `supportsResume` matrix across the connectors.
 *   7. LAUNCH-FAILURE SURFACING (issue #159 Part B1) — the readiness race reports a detached spawn that
 *      dies on arrival (an already-exited handle, the shape a bad `--resume` id produces) as a FAILURE with
 *      the child's last output as the cause, and records no live agent — never a false `✓ started`.
 *   8. MISSED-EXIT REAP (issue #159 B1, review hardening) — an agent that joins presence (→ started) then
 *      dies just as watchExit subscribes (onExit never fires for a late subscriber) is still reaped:
 *      watchExit re-checks status() right after subscribing and removes the leaked agent.
 *   9. SHUTDOWN TEARDOWN (issue #159 B2, review blocker) — Manager.stop() reaps EVERY managed agent (hard-
 *      stops the child + clears the map), not just the lease/endpoints, so a manager shutdown doesn't
 *      orphan their footprints. (The broker-side deprovision is a no-op in open mode — proven under auth in
 *      deprovision-agent-auth.smoke — so this covers the stop() wiring.)
 *  10. BEST-EFFORT TEARDOWN (issue #159 B2, review re-check) — teardownManagedAgents() attempts every
 *      child and empties the map even when one hard-stop throws, so stop() can't exit leaving footprints.
 *  11. BEST-EFFORT STOP ON REAP (issue #159 B2, review round 5) — stopHandle() (the single stop chokepoint)
 *      never throws, so a throwing runtime hard-stop on despawn/self-stop/reap can't abort the freeSlot that
 *      follows; reapChildrenOf continues over every sibling even when one child's stop throws.
 *  12. UNCERTAIN READINESS (issue #159 B1, review design) — when neither presence nor exit is observed
 *      within the backstop, the launch is reported UNCERTAIN: a non-success reply that KEEPS the agent (no
 *      deprovision — it may still be booting), distinct from both started and failed.
