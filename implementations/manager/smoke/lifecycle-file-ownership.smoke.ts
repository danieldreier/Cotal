/**
 * LIFECYCLE FILE-OWNERSHIP + ROSTER-ALLOCATION smoke (control-surface P2 slice 1, Unit A) — proves
 * by EXECUTION the two teardown/allocation defects the freeSlot split closes, at the manager unit
 * level (real JWT broker + real static-auth provisioning through the ephemeral provisioner; fake
 * runtime records the spec and launches nothing, same harness shape as persona-identity-acl).
 *
 * #2 LIFECYCLE-OWNED FILES. A manager-provisioned incarnation's secret family embeds its
 *    lifecycleUid (`<name>.<uid>.creds` — the `.` separator is OUTSIDE the standing-name alphabet,
 *    so no legal standing alias can spell an incarnation base), and teardown consumes ONLY the
 *    recorded/uid-derived paths. So a stale/replayed teardown for a RETIRED incarnation:
 *      - deletes exactly its own uid's file, and
 *      - can NOT reach a same-alias SUCCESSOR's file (a different uid), nor a name-keyed operator
 *        credential it holds no record of (the seeded `<name>.creds` near-miss), nor — the
 *        structural-disjointness negative — a STANDING alias literally named `<name>-<uid>`
 *        (the exact cross-alias collision the flattened `-` encoding allowed).
 *
 * #4 ADVISORY ALLOCATION. `uniqueName` consults the LIVE presence roster (status !== "offline"),
 *    so a spawn against a name a live UNMANAGED peer already holds auto-numbers (foo -> foo-2)
 *    instead of minting a doomed sibling the broker refuses (the 30s launch-uncertain black hole).
 *    An OFFLINE row never occupies — a properly retired name stays reusable. The allocation is
 *    proved ORDERED (A4): the roster read happens only after the initial presence snapshot
 *    resolves — a deferred snapshot holds the spawn, a roster row installed while it is held is
 *    still honored, so removing/moving the await breaks the test.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:lifecycle-files   (needs nats-server + node on PATH; boots its own broker)
