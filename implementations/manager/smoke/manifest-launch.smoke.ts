/**
 * Mesh-manifest launch smoke — proves the `supervise --launch` path: `startAgent({ resolved })`
 * mints creds from the RESOLVED policy (no persona file read for authority), the launch-spec loader
 * rejects untrusted/unsafe input, and `materializePersona` writes a transient, non-authoritative
 * persona (no ACL frontmatter, with a generated header). Boots a throwaway auth broker (the spawn
 * path opens a real ephemeral provisioner connection — withProvisioner — so a live trusted broker
 * with the space streams is part of startAgent's contract now), a fake runtime, decode the minted
 * creds JWT.
 * Run with: pnpm smoke:manifest-launch
 *
 * ── READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A CHECK HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This suite reaches the handler through a PRIVATE CAST — `(mgr as unknown as {opLaunch(...)})
 * .opLaunch(...)` below — so NO CONTRACT IS EVER APPLIED to what it passes. That is not a
 * stylistic note; it produced a real escape. PR #317 added remote manifest deploy (an inline
 * launch spec pushed over the control plane) and a check here asserting `opLaunch boots from an
 * INLINE spec`. It passed. The feature was dead: `LAUNCH_INPUT_SCHEMA` is
 * `additionalProperties:false` over exactly `{runId, name}`, so the ep door refuses the call
 * before `opLaunch` ever runs. Main shipped a PASSING TEST FOR EXACTLY THE FEATURE THAT WAS
 * BROKEN, and it could not catch the break because it tested one layer BELOW the contract that
 * refuses the call. That is not a missing suite; it is a test whose green is meaningless for the
 * property its name claims.
 *
 * Generalise it: any test that reaches past a boundary via a cast proves nothing about traffic
 * that must CROSS that boundary. A door-enforced property needs a door-level suite —
 * `manager-service-ops` / `manager-service-invoke`, which drive `A.call(...)` through the real ep
 * door and are in `smoke:ci`.
 *
 * And the correlation, which is the generalisable half: every suite in this repo that invokes a
 * handler through a cast (this one, `lifecycle-e2e`, `start-model-preflight`) is ALSO outside
 * `smoke:ci`. The ungated set and the below-the-door set are the same set, so #317 was three
 * independent misses — the feature had a test, the test sat below the contract, and it was
 * ungated — each of which alone would have been survivable. When you gate a previously ungated
 * suite, check FIRST whether it reaches its subject through the real door: an ungated suite has
 * never had to be honest about that.
