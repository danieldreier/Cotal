/**
 * CLI SEAT-LOCALITY E2E (#383, #397) — the PUBLIC path, through the real binary, on a two-manager
 * mesh. This is the suite the lane owed: every other test here enters through a function, and the
 * defect being fixed lives in the wiring BETWEEN functions, where a suite that calls the callee
 * directly stays green while the command a person types is still broken.
 *
 * Two claims, and only an end-to-end run can make either:
 *
 *  1. `--on` REACHES THE MINT. `cotal ps --on <instance>` must be answered by that instance. The
 *     capability is shaped in core and consumed in the workspace mint, but the argument travels
 *     agents.ts → resolveControlTarget → connectOrExit to get there; drop it anywhere on that chain
 *     and the unit tests still pass while the flag silently returns to timing out.
 *
 *  2. `stop` FINDS THE SEAT WITHOUT BEING TOLD WHERE IT IS. A seat can only be stopped by the
 *     manager hosting it, and the class queue does not know which that is. With two managers and a
 *     seat on exactly one of them, a bare `cotal stop --name <seat>` has to locate it and pin to its
 *     host. Before seat-locality this failed roughly half the time — whenever the queue handed the
 *     request to the manager that does not have the seat — and failed with `no agent "<name>"`,
 *     naming something the operator can see running.
 *
 * The negative control is the third case: a name that exists NOWHERE must still fail, and must fail
 * saying it searched. Without it, "stop found the seat" is indistinguishable from "stop succeeds at
 * everything", and the locality lookup could be a no-op that happens to work.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:cli-seat-locality   (needs nats-server + node on PATH; boots its own broker)
