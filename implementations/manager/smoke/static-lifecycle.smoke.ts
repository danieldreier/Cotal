/**
 * STATIC §13.1 LIFECYCLE smoke (control-surface P2 slice 1, Unit B) — proves BY EXECUTION, over a
 * real JWT broker with real provisioning and real key-pinned `lifecycle-executor` credentials
 * (fake runtime: nothing launches), the static executor's durable behavior:
 *
 *  1. ACTIVATION (F3/F4): a static spawn persists the durable outer intent (slot row, phase
 *     `provisioning`) and drives the SHARED activation saga — after spawn the slot is `active`
 *     at the incarnation's uid, the head `lifecycle.local.<nkey>` is active (PRINCIPAL-keyed:
 *     the wire authority coordinate is the nkey, never the alias — F5-bind), the uid is
 *     reserved, the gate is open @gen1, and the credential is LEDGERED (`cred.<uid>.<credId>`,
 *     state active) with a BOUNDED exp (F5(b)) before it was materialized.
 *  2. F5(a) membership gate: a live managed principal passes; a terminalizing, retiring, or
 *     retired incarnation's principal is refused; an unknown principal is not claimed.
 *  3. F5(b) renewal: the manager push-remints the SAME identity with a fresh bounded exp — a
 *     second ledger row appears, the file re-signs for the same nkey — and renewal REFUSES once
 *     the lifecycle is terminalizing.
 *  4. TERMINAL (F1, the (b2) order): despawn drives freeze -> head retiring -> B1 revoke (ALL
 *     ledger rows, incl. renewals) -> cleanup -> gate retired (op-pinned) -> head retired ->
 *     slot retired -> alias free; the retiring hold gates same-name reuse meanwhile.
 *  5. Same-name respawn after the terminal: a FRESH uid, the slot CASed over the retired row,
 *     the predecessor's gate/head stay terminally retired (never reused).
 *  6. F3 rollback: a spawn that throws AFTER activation (buildLaunch) drives the exact-op static
 *     terminal — no active orphan survives.
 *  7. RECONCILE (boot sweep): an active slot with no live process is terminalized by
 *     reconcileStaticLifecycles (no active orphan across manager restarts). A ledgerless
 *     orphan (never minted) retires without a broker eviction. A ledgered orphan whose
 *     eviction is unverified stays terminalizing so the alias cannot land in two owners.
 *  8. F2: a static spawn carrying endpointCapabilities is REFUSED at spawn-accept.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:static-lifecycle   (needs nats-server + node on PATH; boots its own broker)

 * with nothing in its output different except the number of ✓ lines — a number it never emitted, so
