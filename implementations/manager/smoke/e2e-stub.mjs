// A real, lightweight agent for the lifecycle e2e (lifecycle-e2e.smoke.ts): connects to the broker with
// its minted creds and registers presence under its assigned id — exactly what a connector's plugin does —
// then idles until killed. This makes the manager's presence-race resolve "started" on a REAL mesh join,
// and leaves a REAL broker footprint (dm_/dlv_ durables + ACL row) for the deprovision assertions.
// COTAL_LIFECYCLE_UID rides through exactly as a real connector forwards it — an authed registering
// endpoint REQUIRES it (fail-before-presence, SPEC 13.1); COTAL_E2E_CONSUME=1 makes the stub bind its
// DM/dlv durables like a full agent (the wrong-uid probe needs the broker's bind denial).
