/**
 * The AUTH SERVICE daemon — the one server-side process a user-auth space runs alongside its broker
 * (the delivery-daemon pattern: spawned detached by `cotal up`, pid-filed per space, torn down by
 * `cotal down`). It hosts BOTH halves of the identity plane, which share state and so belong in one
 * isolated process rather than smeared across the manager/delivery daemons:
 *
 *  - **Plane 2 — the NATS auth callout** ({@link startAuthCallout}): answers `$SYS.REQ.USER.AUTH`
 *    over its own callout-account connection, validating bearers offline against the LOCAL issuer
 *    key set and minting scoped data-account user JWTs.
 *  - **Plane 1 — the token exchange + JWKS, over loopback HTTP**: `POST /exchange` turns a fresh
 *    IdP JWT (from `cotal login`'s cached session) into a Cotal user bearer via the pinned
 *    {@link createIdpBridge}; `GET /jwks` publishes the issuer's public keys.
 *
 * Least-privilege by construction: the daemon loads ONLY provider-owned projected files from its
 * space-scoped state dir (`.cotal/auth/<space>/`) — the data-account signing seed arrives via
 * `service-keys.json` (minting scoped users IS this service's function); the space's operator seed
 * and account seed never enter this process (`prepareServer` wrote the projection and kept the rest).
 *
 * The exchange surface is LOCAL-V1, hardened: loopback bind only; `POST /exchange` requires the
 * per-start high-entropy capability (`Authorization: Bearer <cap>` — readable only from the 0600
 * discovery file, so same-user file ACL is the boundary); requests carrying an `Origin` header are
 * rejected (a browser page can reach loopback; it must not be able to drive the exchange); bodies
 * must be `application/json`; failed exchanges are rate-limited and logged. No CORS headers, ever.
 *
 * REMOTE EXCHANGE — the OPTIONAL second listener (`--exchange-public-port`, also binding
 * 127.0.0.1; TLS terminates at a reverse proxy — in-process TLS was rejected: it duplicates cert
 * renewal and forks deploy). It serves ONLY `GET /health`, `GET /jwks`, `POST /exchange`, and
 * `GET /.well-known/cotal-mesh` (the generated discovery bundle); everything else 404s. Its
 * `/exchange` demands NO capability — honestly: the 0600 cap is a same-uid file-ACL boundary with
 * no remote meaning, so requiring its bytes from a remote caller would prove nothing. The proof on
 * the public face is the credential itself: the human arm presents an EdDSA IdP JWT verified
 * against the pinned JWKS/issuer/audience; the agent arm presents an actorToken whose sha256 must
 * match a FRESH ledger row. Origin rejection, JSON-only bodies, the 64 KB bound, and no-CORS-ever
 * hold verbatim; `view` requests are REFUSED outright (operator surfaces stay loopback-only);
 * failures are bucketed per peer (`--exchange-trusted-proxy` opts into the last X-Forwarded-For
 * hop as the peer key; otherwise the socket remote address) in a bounded LRU, under a global
 * concurrent-admission cap and a hard request deadline — all of it pools SEPARATE from the
 * loopback face's budgets, and successful exchanges stay unthrottled on both faces.
 *
 * Both trust boundaries authorize against the SAME actor ledger, read fresh per request — a revoke
 * bites at the next exchange AND the next connect with no restart.
 *
 * JWKS cache contract (gate 4, explicit): responses carry `Cache-Control: max-age=300`. A verifier
 * may cache the set for up to 5 minutes, so a rotated-out (retired) kid MUST stay published for at
 * least (300s + the max bearer TTL) after rotation before `retire` — otherwise still-live bearers
 * signed by it fail verification at a cold cache. The local callout uses `issuer.localKeySet()`
 * (live, in-process) and is exempt.
 *
 * Readiness contract: the discovery file (`auth-service.json`) is written only AFTER the callout
 * subscription is FLUSHED to the broker and the HTTP listener is bound — its existence (plus a
 * /health probe) IS the readiness signal the provider's `ready()` polls.
