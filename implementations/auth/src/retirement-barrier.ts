/**
 * The D13 (5) TERMINAL RETIREMENT BARRIER + the EXACT-POOL TERMINAL CLEANER (SPEC §13.1, as
 * amended; the §13.9 cleaner matrix row). The third sibling of `lifecycle-registry.ts` /
 * `credential-ledger.ts`: the SAME minting authority over the SAME stores, reached only through
 * the sealed registry ({@link registryStores}).
 *
 * The barrier, in the NORMATIVE order (§13.1) — every boundary crash-resumable from the durable
 * `stage.<opId>` intent, and only the SAME operation resumes it:
 *  1. durable retirement intent (create-only, captured BEFORE any movement; it carries only the
 *     frontier stream set: the barrier DISCOVERS the whole cleaner inventory from the target's
 *     own accepted pool obligations, taking no caller-supplied pool hint, §13.1 #F);
 *  2. CAS the issuance gate `open → frozen` carrying the intent (the bar: a staged mint loses
 *     its finalize touch) — a retirement freeze NEVER reopens (§13.1: its only exit is the
 *     terminal);
 *  3. CAS the head `active → retiring` bound to the same op (every currency seam now yields no
 *     current mapping and no current epoch; the alias is NOT replaceable);
 *  4. the shared containment core ({@link containLifecycleFamily}): revoke every ledger row
 *     under `cred.<uid>.>`, reconcile both halves of every session-derived credential, and
 *     VERIFIED cluster-wide eviction of every holder principal + the alias principal;
 *  5. drain the target's acceptance obligations to quiescence (§13.8): enumerate
 *     `oblig.<targetUid>.>` for endpoint discovery, drive each endpoint's injected drain
 *     ({@link drainTargetForEndpoint} over that endpoint's mediator), then RE-ENUMERATE and
 *     verify — the barrier OWNS the quiescence check, never the injected seam; then, BEFORE
 *     anything else proceeds, fence the drain's per-op repair principals (the commit applier /
 *     pool-route reconciler / effects canceller, {@link drainRepairPrincipals}) with a
 *     cluster-verified eviction — the APPLIER especially, whose records-KV last-value write is
 *     visible to a normal reader regardless of the frontier cutoff (#4);
 *  6. the exact-pool terminal cleaner ({@link runExactPoolCleaner}) under a DISTINCT,
 *     separately minted, bounded-lived profile per (op × endpoint), then — BEFORE any frontier
 *     records — revoke the cleaner's own credential and cluster-verify eviction of its
 *     principal (the §13.1 cleaner fence: no in-flight cleaner can ACK a redelivery or write a
 *     terminal after the alias is reused);
 *  7. record the per-stream retirement frontiers (`frontier.<lifecycleUid>`, create-only,
 *     never deleted — the cutoffs that bound the predecessor's half-open interval);
 *  8. CAS the gate `frozen → retired` (terminal; unlike takeover, never reopened);
 *  9. CAS the head `retiring → retired` — only now is the alias replaceable, and `retired`
 *     ASSERTS the completed barrier.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED CONTRACT: any failure after the freeze leaves the gate FROZEN and the head at its
 * current containment state (nothing mints, the alias is not replaceable); eviction failure is
 * `unavailable`; a live, unexpired, FOREIGN-target pool item is never settled or ACKed and the
 * barrier refuses to close frontiers while one remains (§13.9). A crash BETWEEN the gate
 * terminal (step 8) and the head terminal (step 9) is the one window past the gate's frozen
 * bar: it leaves `gate retired + head retiring` under the SAME op, and the boot resume's
 * cross-object owed-ness (gate AND head) re-enters THIS barrier, whose gate-retired branch
 * finishes step 9 alone from the durable coordinates (#878).
 *
 * SURFACE: NOTHING here is exported from the package index (the same discipline as the
 * takeover barrier); production wiring lands with the activation slices. The executor seam is
 * the sealed registry; an `opId` is an identifier, never a bearer capability.
