/**
 * The D13 NORMATIVE CREDENTIAL LEDGER + the full TAKEOVER ISSUANCE BARRIER, slices (3)+(2b)
 * (SPEC §13.1, as amended). The sibling of `lifecycle-registry.ts`: the SAME minting authority
 * over the SAME two stores, reached only through the sealed registry ({@link registryStores}),
 * so a caller that cannot open the registry can neither write a ledger row nor run a barrier.
 *
 * What is here (all §13.1-normative):
 *  - the AGENT-family ledger rows `cred.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>` — the closed row schema
 *    `{ credentialId, holderPrincipal, lifecycleUid, sourceChain, state: active|revoked, exp }`
 *    (monotonic state; revoked rows are never deleted), the per-ancestor lineage index
 *    `bysrc.<issuerKeyId>.<id>.<lifecycleUid>.<credentialId>`, and the shared row codec the
 *    ENDPOINT family `epcred.<endpoint>.<instanceId>.<credentialId>` reuses (same schema, same
 *    discipline; the session adapter writes that family);
 *  - the MINT PROTOCOL (observe gate → write rows → revision-pinned gate touch-CAS → release):
 *    {@link stageAgentMint} + {@link finalizeAgentMint}. The touch is the §13.1 fence — a gate
 *    (or any presented source gate) that moved since observation makes the pinned write LOSE,
 *    the mint marks its OWN rows revoked and never releases. An unledgered mint cannot occur
 *    through this module: release is gated on finalize, and finalize is gated on the staged
 *    rows existing;
 *  - SOURCE GATES `srcgate.<issuerKeyId>.<id>` (`{ state: open | frozen }`, CAS): every handle
 *    in a presented chain is observed at stage and touch-CASed at finalize, and
 *    {@link revokeHandleSource} is the handle-revocation walk — freeze the source gate FIRST,
 *    enumerate `bysrc.`, revoke every descendant row, then VERIFIED cluster-wide eviction of
 *    every revoked row's holder principal (fail-closed; the gate stays frozen forever);
 *  - the TAKEOVER BARRIER {@link runAgentTakeoverBarrier} in the normative order: durable op
 *    intent (`stage.<opId>`, create-only) → gate CAS `open → frozen` carrying the intent →
 *    point-in-time enumeration of `cred.<lifecycleUid>.>` (the SEALED auth-ledger scanner's
 *    fence-free LastPerSubject read — `ledger-scanner.ts`; the barrier profile holds NO auth-stream
 *    `CONSUMER.CREATE`, whose body cannot be subject-confined, so the CREATE lives only in the
 *    scanner's own sealed credential) → revoke EVERY row → VERIFIED
 *    eviction of every holder principal (the injected `evictPrincipal` seam; `verifiedGone`
 *    is the ONLY success — anything else throws and the gate STAYS frozen) → the epoch head
 *    CAS LAST ({@link advanceEpochWithinTakeover}) → reopen the gate at generation G+1. Every
 *    boundary is crash-resumable from the durable intent ({@link resumeAgentTakeover}), and
 *    only the SAME operation resumes it.
 *
 * Deny-new vs kill-live, stated precisely (the two halves of revocation, §13.1):
 *  - the ledger row CAS is the deny-new SUBSTRATE (rows live in a replicated, leader-served
 *    JetStream KV, `allow_direct=false`, §13.12). The REDEEM arm is wired here: the session
 *    release reads the normative row and refuses a `revoked` one, so a burned session
 *    credential never re-releases. The CONNECT arm (the auth callout reading `cred.<uid>.<id>`
 *    to refuse an OFFLINE credential's reconnect) is NOT wired in this slice: it needs the
 *    ROOT credential ledgered (the head's `currentCredentialId`, which the activation saga
 *    leaves absent until production issuance) and the presented credential to carry its id, so
 *    it lands with production activation wiring. Until then, this barrier's deny-new covers the
 *    REDEEM path and the LIVE connections it evicts; an offline root credential whose lifecycle
 *    UID is preserved across takeover is NOT denied reconnect by the barrier alone (§13.1
 *    requires takeover to FAIL LOUD where it cannot revoke + verified-evict, e.g. static
 *    credentials — enforced at that connect-arm wiring, not here);
 *  - the injected verified eviction is the cluster-wide kill-live with re-scan (core
 *    `evictDeniedPrincipal`: CONNZ scan → per-server KICK → re-scan; partial scans fail
 *    closed), which handles the LIVE half regardless of the connect-arm.
 *
 * SURFACE: NOTHING here is exported from the package index. The executor seam is the sealed
 * registry itself (constructed only over the minting authority's authenticated connection);
 * an `opId` is an identifier, never a bearer capability. Implementation staging lives in the
 * `stage.` family only — never under a ledger prefix a barrier enumerates.
