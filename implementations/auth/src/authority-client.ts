/**
 * The auth service's SELF-MINTED data-account connections (R1). The service already holds the
 * data account's signing seed (minting scoped users IS its function), so its own infrastructure
 * access is signed from that seed directly — a ledgered `cred.`/`epcred.` row would create no
 * enforcement point (connect never re-reads the reader's own row) and would be enumerated by the
 * lifecycle barriers as if it were an agent's. The revoke story is the D5 class: stop the service
 * or rotate the data-account signing seed. A genuinely LEDGERED infra-credential family is the
 * deferred infra-mint work; migrate onto it there, do not invent it here.
 *
 * Two connections, least-privilege by construction:
 *  - the CONNECT READER (`cotal:auth-reader:<space>`): read-only over both authority stores
 *    ({@link authConnectReaderGrants}), supervised — shape-proved on EVERY (re)bind, unproved
 *    while disconnected, so a reader that cannot currently prove its stores DENIES every connect.
 *  - the MINT WRITER (`cotal:auth-mint:<space>`): the exchange-time issuance executor
 *    ({@link authorityWriterGrants}) — store ensure + the activation saga + the root-credential
 *    mint protocol. Its unfenced reads only feed revision-pinned CASes (a stale read LOSES) or a
 *    bearer stamp the leader-served connect arm re-checks, so bind-time proof suffices.
 *
 * RENEWAL IS A FAIL-CLOSED BOUNDARY: each connection authenticates with a SHORT-exp user JWT over
 * a stable nkey, re-minted in-process at half-life; the broker disconnects the connection at JWT
 * expiry and the reconnect presents the freshest mint. A renewal-mint failure fires
 * {@link AuthorityClientOpts.onRenewalFailure} IMMEDIATELY — the supervised reader downs itself
 * on it (unproved + connection closed), so connects DENY from the moment the renewal fails, not
 * only when the old credential eventually expires. A downed reader never comes back without a
 * service restart; there is no file-only fallback.
