/**
 * The core `auth-provider` extension — how a composition root gets user-mode auth WITHOUT importing
 * this package from the CLI (`bin/cotal.ts` imports `@cotal-ai/auth`; `@cotal-ai/cli` resolves the
 * provider from the registry, generically).
 *
 * `prepareServer` is the `cotal up --user-auth` hook. It receives the NARROW provisioning input
 * (core's {@link AuthPrepareInput}: operator seed + data-account pub/signingSeed + the space-scoped
 * state dir — never the whole space bundle), makes all persisted material exist, projects the ONE
 * signing seed the daemon may hold into `service-keys.json`, and hands back:
 *  - the callout account for the broker config preload,
 *  - the non-secret client metadata (trust pins) the workstation registry records ({@link
 *    assertUserAuthInfo} shape — typed in workspace, opaque to core),
 *  - the service handle: the `auth-service` command name + the readiness contract (poll the
 *    discovery file the daemon writes only after BOTH planes are bound, then confirm /health).
