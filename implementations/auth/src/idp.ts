/**
 * Plane-1 IdP bridge — the token exchange that turns an EXTERNAL IdP-authenticated human into a
 * Cotal user bearer (the plan's §"Plane 1"): verify the IdP's JWT offline against its pinned JWKS,
 * derive the opaque per-space owner from the IdP subject, authorize the requested actor against
 * the operator's ledger, and mint the bearer through the {@link UserTokenIssuer}.
 *
 * The bridge is IdP-GENERIC on purpose (pluggable edges): any IdP that publishes an EdDSA/Ed25519
 * JWKS and mints `iss`/`aud`/`sub`/`exp` JWTs plugs in via {@link IdpConfig} — Better Auth (JWT
 * plugin) is the reference IdP, and the integration smoke runs a real instance. Nothing
 * Better-Auth-specific leaks in here.
 *
 * Trust-boundary order inside {@link IdpBridge.exchange} (each step fail-loud, no fallback):
 *  1. the requested actor is grammar-asserted BEFORE anything else touches it;
 *  2. the IdP token verifies against the PINNED key path only — `alg` pinned to EdDSA, embedded
 *     key material (`jku`/`jwk`/`x5u`/`x5c`) rejected outright, exact `iss`/`aud`, `exp` and a
 *     non-post-dated `iat` required, `sub` a non-empty string (no coercion);
 *  3. the owner derives from the JSON-array encoding of [idp issuer, sub] — issuer-namespaced so
 *     the same `sub` from two IdPs can never collide, INJECTIVE by construction (JSON escaping —
 *     no delimiter an issuer/sub pair could straddle), and deterministic so re-login re-lands in
 *     the same lanes. This encoding is FROZEN: changing it (or the IdP issuer string) re-keys
 *     every owner in the space — a migration, like rotating the space secret;
 *  4. the ledger hook AUTHORIZES (owner, actor) and is the ONLY source of `scope`/`parent` — the
 *     request cannot carry them (server-authored `act`, no confused deputy). The hook must return
 *     an explicit grant object; anything else is a deny;
 *  5. the issuer mints (which re-asserts every claim shape — the issuer ↔ validator inverse).
