/**
 * The local ACTOR LEDGER — the server-side authority over which (owner, actor) pairs may run agents
 * in this space, and with what capability scope + channel ACL (plan gate 4: "define the local actor
 * ledger + channel ACL resolver used by both the IdP bridge and callout permission supplier").
 *
 * This is THE single authorization source on the user-auth path — both trust boundaries read it:
 *  - the IdP bridge's `authorizeActor` (Plane 1, bearer MINT time): is this actor granted, and what
 *    `scope`/`parent` does its bearer carry;
 *  - the callout's `authorizeActor` + `AclResolver` (Plane 2, CONNECT time): is the actor STILL
 *    granted (a revoked row kills new connects even while an old bearer lives), has its granted scope
 *    been narrowed since the bearer was minted, and what channel read/post ACL + role gets minted.
 *
 * TWO DISJOINT ROW SPACES, split by construction (the gate-1 review convergence): `actors/` holds
 * INTERACTIVE rows (written by `cotal actor grant`, exchanged via a human IdP proof) and
 * `managed-actors/` holds MANAGED-AGENT rows (written only by the spawn path, carrying the hash of
 * the per-agent secret, exchanged only via that secret). The IdP path reads only the interactive
 * space and the agent path only the managed space, so no corruption, partial write, or misrepair
 * can reclassify a managed child as human-exchangeable — the fail-open class is unrepresentable,
 * not detected. Writers refuse a duplicate (owner, actor) across the two spaces; the CONNECT
 * boundary (which must serve bearers minted by either path) reads both through ONE helper that
 * fails closed on a duplicate.
 *
 * There is NO allow-by-default anywhere: a missing row is a deny, an empty ledger denies everyone.
 * Rows are keyed (owner, actor); the owner is the opaque derived `u_…` token — the ledger holds no
 * IdP subject/email (grant-time derivation maps sub → owner; an optional operator label is for
 * `list` legibility only). Reads are FRESH per call (the delivery-daemon posture): a grant/revoke is
 * live at the very next exchange/connect with no daemon restart.
 *
 * Storage is ONE FILE PER ROW (`<space>/<owner>.<actor>.json`, atomic tmp+rename writes) — the mesh
 * registry's lost-update posture: concurrent grant/revoke (an operator command racing the manager's
 * spawn-time grant) never read-modify-write a shared file, and a crash damages at most one row.
 * UNLIKE the mesh registry, a corrupt row FAILS CLOSED with a thrown sentence — an auth ledger never
 * skips what it cannot read (a "skipped" row would silently revoke or, in a list, silently hide a
 * live grant from the operator).
