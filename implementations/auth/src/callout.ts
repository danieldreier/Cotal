/**
 * Plane-2 auth-callout bridge (ADR-26, operator mode) — the server-side service that turns a
 * validated user bearer into a scoped, short-lived NATS user JWT at connect time.
 *
 * Operator-mode topology (the sentinel pattern):
 *  - a DEDICATED auth account quarantines callout traffic ({@link createCalloutAuth}): the callout
 *    service is its only privileged user, plus a shared deny-all "sentinel" user whose creds
 *    agents present alongside the real bearer in `auth_token`;
 *  - the auth account's JWT carries `authorization { auth_users, allowed_accounts, xkey }`, so the
 *    server routes connects landing there to `$SYS.REQ.USER.AUTH` and lets the response re-bind
 *    the client into the DATA account (`issuer_account` + a user JWT signed by the data account's
 *    signing key);
 *  - the **xkey is mandatory**: {@link startAuthCallout} refuses to start without one, and drops
 *    any request that arrives unsealed or whose signed `server_id.xkey` doesn't match the sealing
 *    header key — without this the bearer crosses the auth path in cleartext (TLS protects the
 *    transport, not this payload).
 *
 * Fail-closed at every step: protocol-shape violations (bad seal, bad signature, key mismatch)
 * get NO response (the server denies on timeout — we cannot authenticate the peer, so we do not
 * talk to it); authenticated-but-invalid bearers get a signed, sealed ERROR response; only a fully
 * validated principal gets a mint. The minted user JWT's expiry is BOUND to the bearer's, so
 * broker access dies with the token (the v1 revocation lever — nats-server disconnects clients at
 * user-JWT expiry).
