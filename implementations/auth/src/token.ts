/**
 * User-token validation — the strict Plane-2 check the auth callout runs on the bearer an agent
 * presents in `auth_token` (SPEC-normative claim shape; the plan's §"Token shape").
 *
 * Claim shape (normative): `sub` = the opaque derived owner · `act` = server-authored
 * { owner, actor, scope?, parent? } with AT MOST one parent/spawner audit link (nested delegation
 * chains are cross-account scope, not this plan) · `aud` = the space · `scope` = capability list ·
 * `ver` = token-shape version (a stale `ver` is rejected — downgrade defense).
 *
 * Validation is fail-closed and pinned end-to-end:
 *  - `alg` pinned to EdDSA (Ed25519) — nothing else verifies;
 *  - key-smuggling headers (`jku` / `jwk` / `x5u` / `x5c`) are rejected outright — the key is
 *    resolved ONLY through the caller-pinned resolver (a `createRemoteJWKSet` on a pinned origin,
 *    or a local key); a `kid` never resolves anywhere else;
 *  - `iss` / `aud` enforced; `exp`, `iat`, and `nbf` are REQUIRED; the lifetime is capped and
 *    ANCHORED TO THE VALIDATOR'S CLOCK — future-dated `iat`/`exp` windows are rejected, not just
 *    long spans (short-lived tokens are the v1 revocation lever — an unbounded or post-dated
 *    token would quietly disable it).
