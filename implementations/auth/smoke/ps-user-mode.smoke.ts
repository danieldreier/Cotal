/**
 * USER-MODE `cotal ps` (fix/ps-option3 C): mode chosen up front — ep.one, not scatter.
 *
 *   1. up --user-auth + device login + admin grant (the arm-2 shape that may reach ps)
 *   2. cotal ps exits 0 (the product claim C authorises)
 *   3. manager killed — ps exits non-zero, never a bare empty list
 *
 * Spawn-only refusal is asserted in user-spawn.smoke.ts B1e (ungated); not duplicated here.
 * Gated: a RED here is C or the user-mode connect path broken.
 *
 * STEP 3 IS DELIBERATELY STRICTER THAN ITS SIBLING, and the difference is not an oversight.
 * `ps-operator-path.smoke.ts` accepts exit 0 for a dead manager as long as the output says
 * "unreachable"; this suite demands a non-zero exit. Different rails, different observable
 * vocabularies: a class scatter can attribute a specific instance and label it unreachable, while
 * `ep.one` has no such label to print — it either got its one answer or it did not. Asking the
 * user-mode path for the operator path's wording would be asking for a sentence it cannot say.
 *
 * The strictness only ever errs toward RED, and only if user-mode ps deliberately moves to a
 * label-and-exit-0 shape. That is a product decision to be made on its own evidence; a red here
 * demanding a human look at it is then the correct behaviour, not a defect in this file.
