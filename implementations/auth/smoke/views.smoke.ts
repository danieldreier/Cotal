/**
 * ELEVATED-VIEWS smoke — the exchange-gated per-connection profiles (`act.view`) pinned
 * broker-free at every layer:
 *
 *   A. issuer ↔ validator inverse: every {@link USER_TOKEN_VIEWS} value round-trips; an unknown
 *      view is rejected at MINT and (via a hand-signed token) at VALIDATE — the enum is closed on
 *      both sides;
 *   B. the central policy table: `deployer` is spawn-gated (own-team deploys are spawn-grade),
 *      every other view is admin-gated;
 *   C. the callout profile switch: no view → agent profile (ACL resolver consulted); a view mints
 *      its profile WITHOUT the channel resolver; a view whose capability list lacks its required
 *      scope refuses to mint (defense in depth); the deployer view's control grant is the
 *      PRIVILEGED tier, never admin;
 *   D. the bridge (synthetic EdDSA IdP): a view exchange is authorized against the FRESH ledger
 *      grant — under-scoped refuses naming the re-grant, granted mints `act.view` lifecycle-BOUND
 *      to the grant row's uid, unknown views refuse, and a uid-less grant cannot mint at all;
 *   E. the connect boundary (`ledgerAuthorizeConnect`, real ledger dir): a VIEW bearer rides the
 *      same lifecycle-equality gate as every other bearer — claimless refuses, and a predecessor
 *      incarnation's still-live view bearer is DENIED after the alias's re-grant rotates the row
 *      (the elevated stale-lifecycle crossover, security HIGH).
