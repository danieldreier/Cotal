/**
 * R1 connect-arm DENY-NEW live smoke (SPEC 13.1) — proves the PRODUCTION composition end-to-end:
 * the auth service's authority plane ({@link openAuthAuthorityPlane}, exactly what the daemon
 * runs) boots on a VIRGIN space (store ensure + registry + supervised reader), the exchange arm
 * mints the incarnation's root credential RELEASE-LAST and stamps `act.credentialId`, and the
 * connect arm requires the LIVE `cred.` row through the leader-served, shape-proved reader:
 *
 *  - happy path: an exchanged-shape bearer (uid + stamped credid) CONNECTS; the ensure is
 *    idempotent (same credid on re-exchange);
 *  - claimless bearer (no `act.credentialId`) → DENIED (the hard cut; no grace, no skip);
 *  - never-issued credid → DENIED (absent row is deny, not a fallback);
 *  - minted-but-unstamped credid (the crash-pin window: row durable, head CAS never ran) →
 *    DENIED (root head equality is the belt over release-last);
 *  - REVOKED row → the NEXT connect is DENIED and the exchange arm REFUSES to re-mint
 *    (rotation is the barrier's job, never a re-mint);
 *  - same-alias re-grant at a NEW uid while the predecessor incarnation is live → the EXCHANGE
 *    refuses loudly naming the takeover gap (the R1 residual; no barrier-less head flip);
 *  - plane closed (reader down) → connects DENY (fail-closed, no file-only fallback).
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:deny-new:auth   (needs nats-server on PATH; local-only)
