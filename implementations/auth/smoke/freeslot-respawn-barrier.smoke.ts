/**
 * FREESLOT RESPAWN BARRIER smoke (control-surface P1 gate). It proves by EXECUTION the
 * despawn/respawn contract that had previously only been established by code-read.
 *
 * THE RACE IT WAS WRITTEN AGAINST, described in the PAST tense because this tree no longer has it:
 *
 *   `freeSlot` freed the agent's name synchronously, then fired `deprovision` DETACHED. Its BROKER
 *   half (`deprovisionBroker`: the dm_/dlv_ durables and the read-ACL row, all keyed by (owner,
 *   actor-name)) ran after the first await, across a cred mint plus a fresh broker connection plus
 *   JS-API deletes. A same-name respawn that provisioned inside that window handed the
 *   REPLACEMENT's freshly minted broker footprint to the stale teardown, which deleted its durables
 *   and ACL row while the manager kept listing it as live.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TREE DOES INSTEAD, which is what the cells below execute. The name is NOT freed while
 * any teardown phase is in flight: the hold clears only after the standing-authority revoke and the
 * lifecycle retirement both confirm. The broker deletes are lifecycle-uid-pinned, so a stale or
 * replayed teardown for a retired incarnation is broker-denied against a same-name successor, whose
 * resource names embed a different uid (`Manager.deprovisionBroker`, SPEC 13.1). The three barrier
 * contracts below are what say so, by running.
 *
 * The BARRIER CONTRACT is the spec/plan acceptance timeline for terminal despawn (retire before
 * alias release; cleanup pinned to the retired lifecycle; detached cleanup = idempotent
 * reconciliation that can never resolve through the current alias occupant):
 *
 *   1. RESERVATION — while the predecessor's cleanup is pending, a same-name spawn must not
 *      yield a new live agent under the exact alias. Holds on this tree: the spawn is refused
 *      with the reserved-pending-retirement operator face (GREEN).
 *   2. LIFECYCLE KEYING — after retirement, the same-alias replacement's broker resources must
 *      be DISTINCT names from the predecessor's. Holds on this tree (GREEN).
 *   3. REPLAY SAFETY — re-delivering the predecessor's captured broker cleanup (the
 *      at-least-once world: crash recovery, redelivery, reconciliation retry) must leave the
 *      live replacement's footprint untouched. Holds on this tree (GREEN).
 *
 * MEASURED on this tree: 24 passed, 0 failed. All three barrier contracts above hold, so the P2
 * slice this suite was written to wait for has landed. It had been reading RED for a reason of its
 * own: phase D retried the respawn 20 times at 250ms, a ~5s budget, while the alias frees in two
 * stages that together take ~8s. Timed from the awaited teardown, the first ~1.0s is refused
 * RESERVED; from ~1.3s to ~7.0s the reservation has released but the predecessor's ADVISORY presence
 * row is still live, so uniqueName numbers the successor `worker-2` and the auth plane refuses that
 * name-form because `-` is the reserved principal name-form separator; the exact alias is taken at
 * ~8.0s. That second stage is bounded by the presence record's TTL plus one sweep tick (endpoint.ts:
 * ttlMs 6000, sweep every ttlMs/3), so the repair is a deadline budgeted past that ceiling, not a
 * product change. The numbered-name refusal inside the window is real and is tracked as #693 and
 * #667: for those few seconds the manager mints a name its own auth plane rejects, rather than the
 * reserved-pending-retirement face it gives in the first second. This suite no longer waits on it.
 * At this branch's merge-base the suite threw before its first cell, so its cells are newly VISIBLE
 * rather than newly caused. The suite is now GATED: it is in bin/smoke/ci-suites.txt, so a CI shard
 * runs it on every push. It was ungated for the month it could not start, which is how the retry
 * budget and the presence TTL drifted past each other with nothing to report it.
 *
 * All three are green under the landed P2 slice (alias reservation + lifecycle-keyed resources +
 * `(principal, lifecycleUid)`-pinned cleanup). The CONTRACT asserts need no edits for that; only
 * a mechanical rename is expected if P2 restructures the private `deprovisionBroker` seam this
 * harness wraps. The teardown's LOCAL half (creds/secret shred + ledger revoke) is asserted GREEN
 * throughout. NOT because it is synchronous: the ledger revoke is AWAITED and production says so
 * itself (`deprovisionBroker`'s doc: "the revoke is awaited and can be deliberately slow, so it is
 * not merely a synchronous prefix"). What holds it is the ORDER of the single-flighted chain, the
 * local half completing before the broker phase begins, plus `standingAuthorityLive`, which is set
 * before the revoke is attempted and RETAINED when it fails so the hold can never free the name
 * (`manager.ts` around the revoke; INT-2 runs that EACCES path). The replay is broker-only.
 *
 * The footprint checks ENUMERATE by principal prefix (via a harness-only inspector cred — no
 * production profile grants CONSUMER.LIST) and attribute predecessor/successor sets by TIMELINE:
 * the successor snapshot is taken only after the predecessor's retirement completed, so the
 * exists-under-prefix ambiguity (a wrong-target delete or no-op cleanup false-greening) cannot
 * arise. The replacement's connectedness is witnessed by its own connect-marker file; readiness
 * alone can ride the SIGKILLed predecessor's lingering presence entry (same principal, no clean
 * leave).
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:freeslot-barrier:live   (pnpm build first — Manager + the agent child load
 * dist; needs nats-server + node on PATH)
