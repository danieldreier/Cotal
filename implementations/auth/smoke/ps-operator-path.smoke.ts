/**
 * THE OPERATOR `ps` PATH WORKS: `cotal up` (static auth, no `--user-auth`, no IdP, no device login,
 * so the CLI presents a locally-minted operator credential) then `cotal ps --space`.
 *
 * A RED HERE IS A REAL DEFECT. It began life as the control arm of a BEFORE/AFTER pair, where a
 * static failure meant "the fixture never armed, grade the pair void". **That reading does not
 * transfer and would be actively harmful now** — as a gated suite its job is the opposite: it says
 * the shipped operator path is broken. The `cotal up` cell below distinguishes the two, and it is
 * checked FIRST for exactly that reason: `up` red means the fixture; `up` green with `ps` red means
 * the product.
 *
 * WHY IT IS GATED. It caught a real regression in its first outing, from a change two people had
 * agreed looked safe: converting the freeze enumeration from `kv.keys()` to a `STREAM.INFO`
 * `subjects_filter` without adding the matching `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.KV_<records>` row to
 * `scatterFreezeReadRows`. The symptom surfaces hundreds of lines from the cause, as a NATS
 * permissions violation on a records-bucket subject, which is why it cost a night to find once.
 *
 * Mutation-proved: delete that grant row and this suite goes red.
